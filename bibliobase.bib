	Abstract = {India is the world's largest producer of pulses, which are an important component of the Indian diet. Stagnant production in that country has contributed to declining per capita consumption over the past 20 years. During this period, domestic pulse prices have increased relative to other foods. Despite a liberal import regime, imports have generally remained a small share of supplies. Most Indian consumers are highly sensitive to prices when making food purchase decisions. Higher relative prices cause consumers to switch to lower priced pulse varieties and grades, and to other food items, such as cereals and vegetables. The recent rise in the popularity of low-priced imported dry peas demon-strates that consumers substitute nontraditional varieties into their diet based on relative prices. U.S. dry peas are not competitive in India because of the limited market for premium grades, as well as the higher costs associated with bagging and containerized shipping. U.S. chickpeas have also been limited to a small, premium-priced niche segment of the market},

	Abstract = {It is evident that there have been some significant changes in the food consumption basket. The latest National Sample Survey data for 2009-10 (66th Round) show a further shift away from food to non-food items in all expenditure categories across both rural and urban areas. This analysis of changes across three rounds (1993-94, 2004-05 and 2009-10) reveals that the pace of change accelerated between 2004-05 and 2009-10.

This study is based on rural wage data taken from various rounds of the National Sample Survey and mainly focuses on the level and trend in wages during the first decade of 21st century. It makes an attempt to identify several variables that could explain the observed variations among Indian states in levels and trends during this period.

	Abstract = {India witnessed a widening of income inequality during the phase of acceleration in economic growth in the post-reform period (1993-94 to 2004-05). This paper analyses the issue by using different types of inequality measurements like general entropy indices, kernel density graphs, percentile of income graphs and field decomposition. It finds two major features of a rising inequality in urban areas: (a) even with a doubling of per capita consumption growth in the post-reform decade, the decline in poverty was less by a quarter compared to the pre-reform decade, and (b) in the post-reform period, the growth of the wage rate of regular workers was negative up to the 50th percentile of wage earnings, and beyond that point, wage rate growth turned positive and rose sharply to reach 5\% per annum in highest quintile of wage earnings.

	Abstract = {The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 promises free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of 6-14 years. But the way this critical entitlement is being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is aimed at ushering in quality elementary education for all. The problems are many, and this paper observes that most of them can be connected to inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of ensuring that the Act&#39;s aims are fulfilled is to bring in a common school system based on neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering variety of indifferent institutions we now have.

	Abstract = {Part-II reports the impact of in-kind food transfers on nutritional intake as measured by calories. Econometric analysis using a simple calorie demand function confirms the significance of variables relating to public distribution system access, controlling for other covariates, in its contribution to calorie intake. Results also suggest that the calorie-elasticity of PDS transfers is twice as large compared to additional out-of-pocket income equal to the cash equivalent of PDS transfers. These are also confirmed by non-parametric analysis of calorie intake of various consumer groups. Although preliminary, these results suggest caution in advocating cash transfers as substitute of in-kind transfers. Finally, the paper evaluates concerns about the financial implications of the minimum support price-PDS system in light of the recently enacted National Food Security Act.

	Abstract = {This paper, in two parts, reports an evaluation of existing in-kind food transfers. Part I outlines the dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer content and physical leakages, and deals with the impact of these transfers on poverty as officially measured. Part II reports the impact of these transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some issues regarding the financial cost of these transfers. Contrary to the view that food self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the need for direct food interventions, the paper reports a significant increase in contribution of in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact is attributable to improved public distribution system efficiency. The first part, presented here, was motivated by some issues that arose in the context of the Tendulkar method of estimating poverty as regards its treatment of food prices. This method treats food prices differently from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper suggests a decomposition method that modifies the Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty reducing impact of these food transfers is found to have increased over time and is more pronounced in the case of distribution-sensitive measures of poverty.

The initial focus is on the ideology and actions which lay behind the functionally destructive institutional restructuring of two established {I}ndian statistical organisations - the Field Operations Division of the National Sample Survey Organisation and the Economic Census.

Examining some of the explicit and not-so-explicit trends in women's work participation in {I}ndia from 1993-94 to 2009-10, this paper argues that indications are that there is a crisis in women's employment under liberalisation-led growth. It shows how specific attention given to unpaid work in nss data can overturn standard assumptions on women's employment and that this is vitally important to discussions on employment growth in {I}ndia.},

@article{jayan2012,
	Abstract = {The growth of gross domestic product in every sub-sector of the {I}ndian economy accelerated during the second half of the 2000s, compared to the first half of the decade. However, employment growth in most sectors except construction decelerated. This jobless growth was partly the result of positive changes such as the reduction of &quot;distress employment&quot; in agriculture, created during the previous half-decade, and an expansion in the population of students. Rural wages rose and average educational levels of the workforce improved. Government interventions in rural {I}ndia since the mid-2000s, particularly the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, seemed to have aided these positive transformations. However, manufacturing employment in the country fell and employment growth slowed down in most constituents of the services sector. The new jobs generated were predominantly in rural construction. The slow progress in the diversification of {I}ndia&#39;s employment structure has led to large-scale withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the number of women thus &quot;missing&quot; being as large as the population of Brazil.

	Abstract = {The findings of the Employment and Unemployment Survey 2011-12 (68th round) reveal that over nine million persons found employment between 2009-10 and 2011-12. This was characterised by some sections of the media as a &quot;rebound&quot; from the stagnancy between 2004-05 and 2009-10. However, our analysis shows that the average growth in employment between 2004-05 and 2011-12 remains low at 2.5 million per year. The findings also reveal that a growing proportion of the workforce is moving to non-farm activities, and a falling proportion is engaged on a casual wage.

As per the irrigated area figures of the Planning Commission, development of groundwater irrigation has reached disturbing levels in many states, notably UP. Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. But the less known volumetric statistics in respect of groundwater irrigation compiled at the behest of the Central Groundwater Board are rather reassuring. Barring a dozen districts of the West Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to have reached the danger mark of groundwater over-exploitation. The reality is somewhere between these extremes, more likely nearer to the Board's than the Commission's assessment.

Misgivings about their being on the high side were reinforced whenever the reported estimates of irrigation potential utilised were compared by some scholars with data from alternative sources. For example, these estimates have tended to exceed the levels based on our agricultural land records. At the end of the Sixth Five- Ycar Plan (i e, 1984-85), the national plan figure of gross irrigated area was placed at 60.58 mha, almost 6 mha more than the corresponding figure of 54.67 mha as per the compilation from land utilisation records. More up-to-date comparison is not possible because data from land record sources are available with a lag of 4-5 year period. In viewof this lag planners are forced to rely on data in respect of plan achievements (in respect of irrigation potential created and utilised) as per the reports of the states which in turn, go by the claims made in this regard by their irrigation departments manned mostly by engineers.

It examines the reasons for this and also looks into how farmers have been responding to lowered groundwater tables. Besides identifying some factors that have not changed since the mid-1980s, it emphasises that there are wide regional variations in the country&#39;s groundwater economy and management strategies need to be crafted accordingly.

In West Bengal they are richer, on average, and are therefore slightly taller. However, when wealth is held constant, children in Bangladesh are taller. This gap can be fully accounted for by differences in open defecation, and especially by open defecation in combination with differences in women&#39;s status and maternal nutrition.},

The report makes the basic point that in spite of the impressive progress humanity has made on many fronts over the decades, it still remains deeply divided. In that context, it is intended to help development actors, citizens, and policy makers contribute to global dialogues and initiate conversations in their own countries about the drivers and extent of inequalities, their impact, and the ways in which they can be curbed.

However, the trends between 2004-05 and 2011-12 indicate that employment generation in the country has been inadequate to meet this challenge. Construction has virtually become the only source of incremental employment in rural {I}ndia. In the urban areas, men have been able to obtain a disproportionate share of high-productivity employment.

	Abstract = {This paper examines the viability of rural banking by the Nationalized Commercial Banks and the factors influencing it. The viability was examined using both cost and profitability analyses. Theory of costs is used for the former, while multi-variate econometric model is formulated for the latter. Factors influencing viability in both the analysis are classified into innovative and non-innovative based on unique characteristics of rural banking in {I}ndia. The results show that rural banking is viable and it could be further improved by reaping scale economies rather than raising interest rate. But this would require more decentralized, autonomous and accountable form of rural banking.},

	Abstract = {This paper attempts to understand the processes of growth in rural non-farm employment based on the 2009-10 employment and unemployment round of the National Sample Survey Office. The rural non-farm sector has undergone major restructuring which has led to an increase in the share of casual labour in the non-farm sector accompanied by a continuous decline in the share of self and regular employment. On the basis of multivariate analyses at two levels, this study concludes that though non-farm employment in rural areas is primarily distress-driven, there are some significant entry barriers for rural workers in the nonfarm sector in terms of education, age and gender. Considering the overall deceleration of rural employment until 2009-10, the paper emphasises the importance of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in rural employment generation and the consequent process of feminisation of casual workforce in the non-farm sector that has emerged in the last five years. The results indicate the crisis of joblessness would have been more acute without the scheme. The overall quality of rural employment, driven by distress factors, has deteriorated in 2009-10 over 2004-05 in a significant way.

The study uses the valuable time series information collected as part of the "comprehensive scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well as costs of cultivation vis-{\`{a}}-vis the wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price level), the value of inputs which are exclusively market-purchased are analysed. A study of the weighted average of these costs establishes unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs increased very sharply in the post-reform period.},

	Abstract = {Public investment in agriculture has significant poverty-reducing effects. This article attempts to analyse trends in agricultural investments in {I}ndia between the 1950s and the 2000s. It argues that public investment and expenditure on agriculture in {I}ndia have grown only slowly and have not decisively increased even after more than 60 years of independence. While public capital formation and expenditure do show a moderate rise in the 2000s, a revival of {I}ndia's agricultural growth requires a far greater thrust to public spending. Major and medium irrigation projects require special attention, as irrigation is instrumental not just in raising yields, but also the number of days of employment for labourers. Increasing public investment in agricultural research and extension is central to bridging the yield gap that persists. Formal credit flows to agriculture have to specifically target small and marginal farmers, and emphasis should move away from generating agricultural growth by channelling credit to agri-business firms and corporate players in agriculture. If {I}ndia's second green revolution has to contribute to an accelerated reduction of poverty, hunger and malnourishment, it undoubtedly has to be a state-led project.},

These agencies are not geared to systematic collection of statistics and the data provided by them are not regular and are often inconsistent. As a result, no reliable statistics exist that could be used to identify patterns of irrigation at the state-level - leave aside doing such exercises at district, block or village levels - with a level of accuracy that is possible for some of the other states. This paper provides an overview of the different sources of data on irrigation in West Bengal and discusses the nature of the data available from each source.},

The focus of this paper is on Dalit or Scheduled Caste households. We begin with very simple measures of differences between groups, such as proportional representation in different quintiles and the frequency distribution of households across income levels in different social groups. We then estimate a standard GE(2) inequality index along with its decomposition by caste. Lastly, we compute an alternative benchmark for assessing the share of between-group inequality in total inequality as suggested by Elbers, Lanjouw, Mistiaen, and Ozler (ELMO 2008). Our analysis shows high levels of income inequality between households of different caste groups.},

	Abstract = {The 55th round (1999-2000) of the NSS used a different methodology from all previous rounds and arrived at lower poverty estimates. The consensus from earlier NSS rounds, that poverty reduction had been set back during the 1990s, was challenged by this data. This was bolstered by some 'adjustments', which although agreeing that the 55th round had overestimated poverty reduction, claimed that the number of poor had nonetheless fallen by 30-45 million. However, a detailed re-examination shows that these 'adjustments' were not correct. The poverty ratio fell at most by 3 percentage points between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, and it is likely that the number of poor increased over this period. The main lesson is that poverty estimates are very sensitive to both survey design and post-survey analysis. The first of a two-part article.},

While the pros and cons of GM cotton are extensively debated, there are only a few empirical studies on the economic performance of Bt cotton, particularly under rainfed conditions. The results from a detailed survey of farm business incomes show that Bt cotton was a clear leader in terms of production and gross value of output when grown as a stand-alone crop. However, on the fields of small and marginal farmers, where cotton was usually intercropped with sorghum (or other cereals and pulses), the relative income advantage of Bt cotton declined. Further, expenditure on chemical pesticides was higher for Bt cotton than for other varieties of cotton. Variability in production was also higher for Bt cotton than for other types of cotton.},

@article{msvr_inequality_2011,
	Abstract = {There is a misconception in the literature that income distribution in {I}ndia is less unequal than, for instance, in China or the countries of Latin America. This misconception is based on a comparison of like with unlike. Studies of income distribution for most countries are based � as they should be � on household income data, while corresponding studies of income distribution for {I}ndia are based on household consumption expenditure data, and it is well known that consumption expenditure, by its very nature, is less unequally distributed than income. This paper examines levels of household income inequality in rural {I}ndia using data from in-depth village surveys conducted in eight villages from four States of the country. Although the data-set is relatively small, the exercise is rather unique because of the lack of regular survey data on household incomes for rural {I}ndia. The Gini coefficient is used as a summary measure of income inequality. Our estimates show high values of the Gini (close to 0.60) in these eight villages; these are comparable to levels reported for Latin America. Of the eight villages, inequality was relatively high in the three canal-irrigated villages.},

	Abstract = {The establishment of the new institution of the regional rural banks (RRBs) in {I}ndia since 1975 has aroused a great deal of interest and controversy among the policy-makers and observers of the {I}ndian economy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the background and salient features of the scheme for establishing the RRBs and to evaluate their performance. The paper concludes that the RRBs have been set up for meeting a distinctive objective and felt need in the area of rural credit. They may be identified as the development banks of the rural poor in {I}ndia. These banks have had to work under several constraints some of which were totally beyond their control. Due credit must be given to the RRBs and their sponsoring banks for having achieved some tangible results within a short period of time. The paper cites the experience of the working of two RRBs as case studies. Based on the experience gained so far, this paper presents a case for reorganizing the working of the RRBs along certain lines for strengthening their role so that they can achieve the objectives for which they have been set up.},
