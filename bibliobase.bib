                  confidence intervals, and statistical power have
                  been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key
                  problem is that there are no interpretations of
                  these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive,
                  correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and
                  interpretation of these statistics requires an
                  attention to detail which seems to tax the patience
                  of working scientists. This high cognitive demand
                  has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and
                  interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes
                  disastrously so---and yet these misinterpretations
                  dominate much of the scientific literature. In light
                  of this problem, we provide definitions and a
                  discussion of basic statistics that are more general
                  and critical than typically found in traditional
                  introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a
                  resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers
                  of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory
                  and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid
                  and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how
                  violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such
                  as selecting analyses for presentation based on the
                  P values they produce) can lead to small P values
                  even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and
                  can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis
                  is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of
                  25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence
                  intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines

abstract = {Abstract Standard policy prescriptions for improving public health in less developed countries (LDCs) prioritise raising average income levels over redistributive policies since it is widely accepted that ‘wealthier is healthier’. It is argued that income inequality becomes a significant predictor of public health only after the ‘epidemiological transition’. This paper tests this theory in India, where rising income levels have not been matched by improvements in public health. We use state-, district-, and individual-level data to investigate the relationship between infant and under-five mortality, and average income, poverty, income inequality, and literacy. Our analysis shows that at both state- and district-level public health is negatively associated with average income and positively associated with poverty. But, at both levels, controlling for poverty and literacy renders average income statistically insignificant. At state-level, only literacy remains a significant and negative predictor. At the less aggregated district-level, both poverty and literacy predict public health but literacy has a stronger effect than poverty. Inequality does not predict public health at state- or district-levels. At the individual-level, however, it is a strong predictor of self-reported ailment, even after we control for district average income, individual income, and individual education. Our analysis suggests that wealthier is indeed healthier in India – but only to the extent that high average incomes reflect low poverty and high literacy. Furthermore, inequality has a strong effect on self-reported health. Standard policy prescriptions, then, need revision: first, alleviating poverty may be more effective than raising average income levels; second, non-income goods like literacy may make an important contribution to public health; and third, policy should be based on a broader understanding of societal well-being and the factors that promote it.},

We decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association between income distribution and population health, and classified them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis that greater income differences are associated with lower standards of population health. Analyses in which all adjusted associations between greater income equality and higher standards of population health were statistically significant and positive were classified as “wholly supportive”; if none were significant and positive they were classified as “unsupportive”; and if some but not all were significant and supportive they were classified as “partially supportive”. Of those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies where income differences are bigger. There were substantial differences in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality was measured in large or small areas. We suggest that the studies of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority of studies. First, many studies measured inequality in areas too small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society; second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We finish by discussing possible objections to our interpretation of the findings.},

Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short. The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations.},

The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced \{OECD\} countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945–1980) — social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist — in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities, such as the overall distribution of income derived from capital versus labor, wage dispersion in the labor force, the redistributive effect of the welfare state, and the levels and types of employment/unemployment; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families, such as child care and domiciliary care; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality rates. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and full-employment policies, such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations, such as reducing infant mortality. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency, as in the liberal tradition, is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches on the importance of political forces in influencing inequalities. The data used in the study are largely from \{OECD\} health data for 1997 and 1998; the \{OECD\} statistical services; the comparative welfare state data set assembled by Huber, Ragin and Stephens; and the \{US\} Bureau of Labor Statistics.},

On the latter topic Wilkinson and others believe that, in the advanced capitalist countries, higher income inequality leads to lowered social cohesion which in turn produces poorer health status. I argue that, despite a by-now voluminous literature, not enough attention has been paid to the social context of income inequality — health relationships or to the causes of income inequality itself. In this paper I contend that there is a particular affinity between neo-liberal (market-oriented) political doctrines, income inequality and lowered social cohesion. Neo-liberalism, it is argued, produces both higher income inequality and lowered social cohesion. Part of the negative effect of neo-liberalism on health status is due to its undermining of the welfare state. The welfare state may have direct effects on health as well as being one of the underlying structural causes of social cohesion. The rise of neo-liberalism and the decline of the welfare state are themselves tied to globalization and the changing class structures of the advanced capitalist societies. More attention should be paid to understanding the causes of income inequalities and not just to its effects because income inequalities are neither necessary nor inevitable. Moreover, understanding the contextual causes of inequality may also influence our notion of the causal pathways involved in inequality-health status relationships (and vice versa).},

It then presents an alternative class-based model through a focus on the causes and not only the consequences of income inequalities. In this model, the relationship between income inequality and health appears as a special case within a broader causal chain. It is argued that global and national socio-political-economic trends have increased the power of business classes and lowered that of working classes. The neo-liberal policies accompanying these trends led to increased income inequality but also poverty and unequal access to many other health-relevant resources. But international pressures towards neo-liberal doctrines and policies are differentially resisted by various nations because of historically embedded variation in class and institutional structures. Data presented indicates that neo-liberalism is associated with greater poverty and income inequalities, and greater health inequalities within nations. Furthermore, countries with Social Democratic forms of welfare regimes (i.e., those that are less neo-liberal) have better health than do those that are more neo-liberal. The paper concludes with discussion of what further steps are needed to ‘go beyond’ the income inequality hypothesis towards consideration of a broader set of the social determinants of health.},

  abstract={The authors propose a modification to the conventional approach of decomposing income inequality by population sub-groups. Specifically, they propose a measure that evaluates observed between-group inequality against a benchmark of maximum between-group inequality that can be attained when the number and relative sizes of groups under examination are fixed. The authors argue that such a modification can provide a complementary perspective on the question of whether a particular population breakdown is salient to an assessment of inequality in a country. As their measure normalizes between-group inequality by the number and relative sizes of groups, it is also less subject to problems of comparability across different settings. The authors show that for a large set of countries their assessment of the importance of group differences typically increases substantially on the basis of this approach. The ranking of countries (or different population groups) can also differ from that obtained using traditional decomposition methods. Finally, they observe an interesting pattern of higher levels of overall inequality in countries where their measure finds higher between-group contributions.},

Specifically, it shows that within a framework of economic growth, the Indian economy can both expand employment opportunities for workers, peasants and the poor while also reducing CO2 emissions. The model assumes that India grows at an average annual rate of 6.0% over a 20-year period. Within this framework, it proposes that India increase its annual total of public and private investments in energy efficiency and clean renewable energy sources by 1.5% of gross domestic product. The paper finds that India will achieve dramatic CO2 emissions reductions and generate major gains in employment opportunities by undertaking these clean energy investments, as opposed to maintaining the economy's existing fossil-fuel based energy infrastructure. India could accomplish these goals while also eliminating entirely its reliance on nuclear power.},

But it turned out to be a miserable scheme of giving loans to the poor with an element of subsidy for some small asset like a buffalo. In the beginning the poor were not even aware of it and better-off farmers got the buffaloes in the name of their servants who were just asked to affix their signature/thumb impression on the application form. There were cases when corrupt lower functionaries at the block level misappropriated the loan on the basis of fake applications. When the racket assumed serious proportions it became mandatory to affix a photograph of the applicant but this did not end the mischief In rural areas there are indigent persons who need small sums to meet their daily requirements or to repay small consumption loans. A small amount used to be paid to them for signing the application form; the loan amount would be withdrawn; the subsidy, usually 331/3 per cent of the loan, would be pocketed and the rest paid back to the bank. Thus targets were fulfilled and the recovery was cent per cent as also speedy and the corrupt village development officer (VDO) would get approbation for overfulfilment of targets and more importantly for quick recovery of loans. Incidentally, VDOs were previously known as 'gram sewaks', i.e, village servants. They resented being called 'gram sewaks' and considered it derogatory. They agitated for a change in their designation and now they are known as village development officers. One can understand the commitment of such functionaries who have descended on the rural areas.},

  abstract={The results of the review do not disappoint. The authors identified more than 120 cash transfer programs that were implemented between 2000 and mid-2009 in Sub-Saharan Africa. These programs have varying objectives, targeting, scale, conditions, technologies, and more. A sizable number of these programs conducted robust impact evaluations that provide important information, presented here, on the merits of cash transfer programs and their specific design features in the African context. The authors present summary information on programs, often in useful graphs, and provide detailed reference material in the appendixes. They highlight how many of the cash transfer programs in Africa that had not yet begun implementation at the time of writing will continue to provide important evaluation results that will guide the design of cash transfer programs in the region. In addition to presenting data and analysis on the mechanics of the programs, the authors discuss issues related to political economy. They highlight the importance of addressing key tradeoffs in cash transfers, political will, and buy-in, and they emphasize the need to build evidence-based debates on cash transfer programs. Useful anecdotes and discussion illustrate how some programs have dealt with these issues with varying degrees of success. This text will serve as a useful reference for years to come for those interested in large- and small-scale issues of cash transfer implementation, both in Africa and beyond. However, the book is not an end in itself. It also raises important questions that must be addressed and knowledge gaps that must be filled. Therefore, it is useful both in the information it provides and in the issues and questions it raises.},

                  in Sub-Saharan Africa and, far from decreasing, the
                  proportion and numbers of poor people in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa have actually increased over the last ten
                  years. Policies to reduce poverty in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa (SSA) and elsewhere are defying conventional
                  wisdom. Single-focus solutions have proved
                  ineffective. There is an urgent need to learn from
                  both successful and failed experiences that have
                  been tried elsewhere. This study provides an ex-ante
                  assessment of the implementation of a cash transfer
                  programme conditional on school attendance in 15
                  Sub-Saharan African countries. Conditional cash
                  transfer (CCT) programmes have been tried in other
                  regions, notably Latin America, with relative
                  success. The two key characteristics of CCT
                  programmes are that they simultaneously act upon the
                  short and long term dimensions of poverty. Therefore
                  we investigate here both the impact of a cash
                  transfer on current poverty and the impact of
                  conditioning the transfer upon school attendance.},

At the all-India level, diversion of pds grain remains a serious issue; however there are interesting contrasts at the state level. Based on trends in monthly per capita purchase of pds grain and estimated diversion, states are categorised into three groups - "functioning", "reviving" and "languishing" states. The paper also discusses the possible reasons for the improvement in the pds in the reviving states and questions the assessment of the pds as uniformly and irreversibly dysfunctional.},

  abstract =     {Data collected in the late 1980s from eight
                  countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Burundi, Ghana,
                  Togo, and Uganda), Asia/North Africa (Sri Lanka and
                  Morocco), and the Americas (Bolivia and Guatemala)
                  were combined and analyzed to test whether
                  incremental health effects regarding diarrhea and
                  nutritional status result from incremental
                  improvements in water and sanitation
                  conditions. Rural (n = 11, 992) and urban (n = 4,
                  888) samples were analyzed separately. Optimal
                  (i.e., on the premises) and intermediate (improved
                  public water). water supplies were compared with
                  unimproved water conditions. Optimal (flush toilets
                  or water-seal latrines) and intermediate (latrines)
                  sanitation levels were compared with unimproved
                  sanitation. Nationally representative (random)
                  samples of ever-married women aged 15--49 years, with
                  or without children, were interviewed in all
                  countries, and children aged 3--36 months with
                  available weight and height data were included in
                  the analyses. Multiple linear regression controlled
                  for household, maternal, and child-level variables;
                  in addition, dummy variables were included for each
                  country. Improvements in sanitation resulted in less
                  diarrhea and in taller and heavier children with
                  each of the three levels of water
                  supply. Incremental benefits in sanitation were
                  associated with less diarrhea and with additional
                  increases in the weights and heights of
                  children. The effects of improved sanitation were
                  greater among urban dwellers than among rural
                  dwellers. Health benefits from improved water were
                  less pronounced than those for sanitation. Benefits
                  from improved water occurred only when sanitation
                  was improved and only when optimal water was
                  present. These findings suggest that public health
                  interventions should balance epidemiologic data with
                  the cost of services and the demand for water. There
                  should be efforts to develop compatible technologies
                  so that incremental improvements in service can be
                  made.},

  abstract =     {The demand for milk and milk products is rapidly
                  increasing with achievement of high economic growth
                  in India. Chances that demand growth will surpass
                  the output growth are high. In the past, substantial
                  increment in production was achieved with the
                  implementation of a comprehensive dairy development
                  programme operation flood. It is contented that the
                  future increase in milk production will have to be
                  met by increasing the productivity of dairy
                  animals. However, productivity augmentations are
                  difficult to come by in the given
                  circumstances. While proposing that greater
                  availability of concentrate feeds was primarily
                  responsible for improved production in the past, it
                  is opined that available technology is of limited
                  use in supporting future productivity
                  improvement. Similarly, genetic improvement of
                  animals, which was largely responsible for milk
                  production increases in the past, will prove
                  contentious. Constraints in the supply of feed and
                  fodder are also highlighted. Hindrances in the
                  delivery of veterinary support services, which are
                  likely to play a crucial role, are outlined. Lack of
                  research and development support and adequate market
                  access to smallholders as factors contributing to
                  the list of challenges are identified. Issues of
                  contemporary market failing to incentivise the
                  producers are highlighted besides identifying the
                  reasons for resistance to shift to neo-liberal
                  market structures. Finally, climate change, as
                  having direct and indirect adverse effects on the
                  production, is identified as a factor adding to the
                  complexity of situation. While seeking to analyse
                  the current challenges confronting the Indian dairy
                  sector in the face of imminent demand increases, it
                  is concluded that a multifaceted programme of the
                  nature and extent of operation flood is needed. It
                  is suggested that this will provide the much
                  required momentum to different components of the
                  milk production system.}

  Abstract =     {Contributions made by five groups of investigators
                  to the knowledge of the stability of different
                  iodine compounds in salt, and of the extent of the
                  losses of iodine which may occur when iodized salt
                  is exposed to different conditions of storage and
                  use, are discussed by the author. Stability of the
                  iodine component in iodized salt is determined by:
                  (1) moisture content of the salt and humidity of the
                  atmosphere; (2) light, heat, and other
                  meteorological factors; (3) impurities in the salt;
                  (4) acidity or alkalinity of the mixture; and (5)
                  the form in which iodine is present. When potassium
                  iodide or sodium iodide is used as the iodizing
                  agent, the iodide content of the salt will remain
                  constant and its distribution will remain uniform
                  for many months if the salt is packed dry in a
                  container with an impervious lining and kept dry,
                  preferably in a cool place and away from strong
                  light. When these conditions cannot be met, it is
                  desirable to iodize salt with potassium
                  iodate. Under adverse conditions of moisture, heat,
                  and sunlight, the iodine content of salt iodized
                  with potassium iodate remains relatively constant.},

                  towards the goal of achieving security of food
                  production. Underutilized or neglected crops species
                  are often indigenous ancient crop species which are
                  still used at some level within the local, national
                  or even international communities, but have the
                  potential to contribute further to the mix of food
                  sources than they currently do. The most
                  cost-effective and easily disseminated changes that
                  can be made to a crop are changes to the genetics,
                  as these are contained within the seed itself and,

                  food and agricultural policy provides tremendous
                  opportunities for advancing the public's health. It
                  is particularly challenging, however, for
                  professionals to understand and consider the
                  numerous policy drivers that impact the food system,
                  which range from agricultural commodity policies to
                  local food safety ordinances. Confronted with this
                  complexity in the food system, policy advocates
                  often focus on narrow objectives with disregard for
                  the larger system. This commentary contends that, in

                  professionals need to consider the full range of
                  interdependent policies that affect the system. Food
                  policy councils have proven to be an effective tool,
                  particularly at the local and state level, for

                  to the exclusion of other goals, today's food system
                  is on an unsustainable course. The problem begins
                  with and is driven by industrialized production of
                  both crops and animals. Industrialization is a
                  product of technological change, public policy, and,
                  most recently, globalized trade. The lack of
                  sustainability derives from reliance on the
                  intensive use of nonrenewable and hard-to-renew
                  resources--soil, antibiotics, fresh water, and fossil
                  fuels, for example--but also from the waste and
                  pollution created by the industrial model. For at
                  least 50 years, American agriculture policies have
                  promoted production of, and ultimately lower market
                  prices for, commodity crops like corn, wheat, and
                  soybeans. Over the last 3 decades in particular,
                  these "cheap food" policies have exacerbated the
                  negative impacts of an industrialized agriculture on
                  the health of the agro-ecosystem, as well as on the
                  health of the humans who must share and be sustained
                  by it. Sustainability and health are two sides of
                  the same food system coin. Policies that put US food
                  production on more sustainable footing can help aid
                  in public efforts to address the myriad crises
                  confronting both the food and health systems. }

                  policy reconfiguration in the mid-20th century. Then
                  the demon was supply, and poor health was mainly due

                  was to raise output and reduce prices. Today the
                  challenge is more complex, a coexistence of over-,
                  under-, and malconsumption alongside continuing
                  gross inequalities within and between nations. The
                  article proposes that a new paradigm is emerging,
                  termed here ecological public health, which sees
                  human and planetary health as linked and food as a
                  key connection point. The article outlines aspects
                  of what this entails, stressing the need for food
                  policy to address not just supply but governance and
                  consumer cultural challenges too. Seven priorities
                  are proposed for policy-makers. }

  abstract =     { The mapping and analysis of supply chains is a
                  technique increasingly used to address problems in
                  the food system. Yet such supply chain management
                  has not yet been applied as a means of encouraging
                  healthier diets. Moreover, most policies recommended
                  to promote healthy eating focus on the consumer end
                  of the chain. This article proposes a
                  consumption-oriented food supply chain analysis to
                  identify the changes needed in the food supply chain
                  to create a healthier food environment, measured in
                  terms of food availability, prices, and
                  marketing. Along with established forms of supply
                  chain analysis, the method is informed by a
                  historical overview of how food supply chains have
                  changed over time. The method posits that the actors
                  and actions in the chain are affected by
                  organizational, financial, technological, and policy
                  incentives and disincentives, which can in turn be
                  levered for change. It presents a preliminary
                  example of the supply of Coca-Cola beverages into
                  school vending machines and identifies further
                  potential applications. These include fruit and
                  vegetable supply chains, local food chains, supply
                  chains for health-promoting versions of food
                  products, and identifying financial incentives in
                  supply chains for healthier eating. }

                  obesity as an argument to promote local produce or

                  questionable. Framing obesity as an issue of poverty

  abstract =     {Highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the United
                  States are found among the lower-income groups. The
                  observed links between obesity and socioeconomic
                  position may be related to dietary energy density
                  and energy cost. Refined grains, added sugars, and
                  added fats are among the lowest-cost sources of
                  dietary energy. They are inexpensive, good tasting,
                  and convenient. In contrast, the more nutrient-dense
                  lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit
                  generally cost more. An inverse relationship between
                  energy density of foods (kilojoules per gram) and
                  their energy cost (dollars per megajoule) means that
                  the more energy-dense diets are associated with
                  lower daily food consumption costs and may be an
                  effective way to save money. However, economic
                  decisions affecting food choice may have physiologic
                  consequences. Laboratory studies suggest that
                  energy-dense foods and energy-dense diets have a
                  lower satiating power and may result in passive
                  overeating and therefore weight gain. Epidemiologic
                  analyses suggest that the low-cost energy-dense
                  diets also tend to be nutrient poor. If the rise in
                  obesity rates is related to the growing price
                  disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods, then
                  the current strategies for obesity prevention may
                  need to be revised. Encouraging low-income families
                  to consume healthier but more costly foods to
                  prevent future disease can be construed as an
                  elitist approach to public health. Limiting access
                  to inexpensive foods through taxes on frowned upon
                  fats and sweets is a regressive measure. The broader
                  problem may lie with growing disparities in incomes
                  and wealth, declining value of the minimum wage,
                  food imports, tariffs, and trade. Evidence is
                  emerging that obesity in America is a largely
                  economic issue.},

  year =         2008,
  abstract =     {A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet
                  quality follows a socioeconomic gradient. Whereas
                  higher-quality diets are associated with greater
                  affluence, energy-dense diets that are nutrient-poor
                  are preferentially consumed by persons of lower
                  socioeconomic status (SES) and of more limited
                  economic means. As this review demonstrates, whole
                  grains, lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products,
                  and fresh vegetables and fruit are more likely to be
                  consumed by groups of higher SES. In contrast, the
                  consumption of refined grains and added fats has
                  been associated with lower SES. Although
                  micronutrient intake and, hence, diet quality are
                  affected by SES, little evidence indicates that SES
                  affects either total energy intakes or the
                  macronutrient composition of the diet. The observed
                  associations between SES variables and diet-quality
                  measures can be explained by a variety of
                  potentially causal mechanisms. The disparity in
                  energy costs between energy-dense and nutrient-dense
                  foods is one such mechanism; easy physical access to
                  low-cost energy-dense foods is another. If higher
                  SES is a causal determinant of diet quality, then
                  the reported associations between diet quality and
                  better health, found in so many epidemiologic
                  studies, may have been confounded by unobserved
                  indexes of social class. Conversely, if limited
                  economic resources are causally linked to
                  low-quality diets, some current strategies for
                  health promotion, based on recommending high-cost
                  foods to low-income people, may prove to be wholly
                  ineffective. Exploring the possible causal relations
                  between SES and diet quality is the purpose of this
                  review.},

  Abstract =     {&quot;Missing labour force in India&quot; - the
                  recent fluctuations in the labour participation of
                  women - is probably due to short-term shifts in
                  activities responding to favourable economic
                  conditions. Such fluctuations need to be placed in
                  the context of a structural change in labour
                  participation wherein the share of women in the
                  labour force as well as labour participation rate of
                  women has been declining for the last quarter of a
                  century. Upward social mobility in Indian
                  patriarchal society in the wake of growing incomes
                  is probably symbolised by women&#39;s withdrawal
                  from paid labour and their confinement to unpaid
                  domestic activities. Even under such adverse
                  conditions employment growth of women is not
                  stagnant. Those who do enter and remain in the
                  labour market are women from the most vulnerable
                  households, as marginalised informal paid labour,
                  thus feminising the most precarious forms of labour
                  in the country. },

  Abstract =     {The 61st round (2004-05) of the National Sample
                  Survey showed that there was a turnaround in
                  employment growth in rural India after a phase of
                  jobless growth during the 1990s. Paradoxically, this
                  employment growth occurred during a period of
                  widespread distress in the agricultural sector with
                  low productivity, price instability and stagnation
                  leading to indebtedness. This paper reveals that
                  employment growth in the rural areas was probably a
                  response to the income crisis that is gripping
                  farming. Under conditions of distress, when income
                  levels fall below sustenance, then the normally
                  non-working population is forced to enter the labour
                  market to supplement household income. The decline
                  of the agricultural sector has also probably created
                  forced sectoral and regional mobility of the working
                  population, with the non-working population
                  complementing them.},

  Abstract =     {Some Data and Conceptual Biases Bina Agarwal There
                  continues to be little appreciation that problems of
                  unemployment, poverty and destitution are in many
                  instances gender-specific so that any serious
                  attempt to alleviate these conditions and/or prevent
                  their further aggravation would require a particular
                  focus on the women of poor households. The accuracy
                  of national level statistics, which usually serve as
                  the principal data input in the framing of
                  development policies, is severely impaired by biases
                  which lead to an undercounting of women, both as
                  workers and as those available for work. This paper
                  seeks to spell out the nature and sources of these
                  data biases and attempts to provide pointers on how
                  they could be corrected and some of the data gaps
                  filled. },

                  to share the same distribution of genetic height
                  potential. In West Bengal they are richer, on
                  average, and are therefore slightly taller. However,
                  when wealth is held constant, children in Bangladesh
                  are taller. This gap can be fully accounted for by
                  differences in open defecation, and especially by
                  open defecation in combination with differences in
                  women&#39;s status and maternal nutrition.},

  Abstract =     {This paper provides a documented account of what
                  drove the post-1991 statistical policy shifts which
                  contributed so much to what the Report of the
                  Committee on Unorganised Sector Statistics (2012)
                  describes as the &quot;challenges&quot; of ensuring
                  the quality and credibility of {I}ndia&#39;s
                  statistical database. The initial focus is on the
                  ideology and actions which lay behind the
                  functionally destructive institutional restructuring
                  of two established {I}ndian statistical
                  organisations - the Field Operations Division of the
                  National Sample Survey Organisation and the Economic
                  Census. An account of the consequences follows. },

                  them could be explained as teething problems. As the
                  experience of Rajasthan shows, there is scope for
                  better implementation. All said and done, NREGA has
                  created a sense of hope amongst the rural poor. This
                  sense of hope can be further strengthened if people
                  understand that the act gives them employment as a
                  matter of right, and that claiming this right is
                  within the realm of possibility.},

  Abstract =     {The combining of benefits for human nutrition and
                  agricultural productivity, resulting from breeding
                  staple food crops which are more efficient in the
                  micronutrient metal uptake from the soil, and which
                  accumulate more micronutrients into their seeds,
                  results in extremely high ex ante estimates of
                  benefit/costs ratios for investments in agricultural
                  research in this area. This finding derives from the
                  confluence of several complementary factors:* Rates
                  of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing
                  countries, as are the consequent costs to human
                  welfare and economic productivity. * Because staple
                  foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the
                  malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple foods
                  (fortified by the plants themselves during growth)
                  can rely on existing consumer behavior. * A
                  significant percentage of the soils in which these
                  staple foods are grown are `deficient' in these
                  micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields
                  low. In general, these soils in fact contain
                  relatively high total amounts of micronutrient
                  metals. However, because of binding to soil
                  constituents, these nutrients have poor soil
                  availability to staple crop varieties that are
                  currently available to farmers. * Adoption and
                  spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by
                  farmers can rely on profit incentives, either
                  because of agronomic advantages on trace
                  mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of
                  nutritional improvements in the most productive
                  varieties being released by agricultural research
                  stations. * Benefits to relatively small investments
                  in agricultural research may be disseminated widely,
                  potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of
                  people and millions of hectares of cropland. *
                  Benefits from breeding advances, derived from
                  initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high
                  recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly
                  sustainable as long as an effective domestic
                  agricultural research infrastructure is
                  maintained. },

  Abstract =     {Abstract About half of the world population suffers
                  from the malnutrition of iron, zinc, calcium, iodine
                  and selenium. Most of the major staple crops of the
                  world, such as rice, wheat, cassava, beans, sweet
                  potato, pearl millet or maize are often deficient in
                  some of these mineral elements. Hence, increasing
                  the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients in
                  edible crop tissues (biofortification) has become a
                  promising strategy in modern agriculture, allowing
                  the access of more nutritious foods, to more people,
                  with the use of fewer resources. Traditional
                  agricultural practices can partly enhance the
                  nutritional value of plant foods, but the advances
                  in the `omics' technologies are rapidly being
                  exploited to engineer crops with enhanced key
                  nutrients. Ionomics, or the study of the ionome
                  (which can be defined as the mineral trace element
                  composition of a particular organism), is a modern
                  functional genomics tool that can provide high
                  throughput information about the broad spectrum
                  nutrient composition of a given plant food. In
                  alliance with other `omics' technologies, such as
                  genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics it can be
                  used to identify numerous genes with important roles
                  in the uptake, transport and accumulation of mineral
                  nutrients in plant foods, in particular in their
                  edible parts. This review provides a critical
                  comparison of the strategies that have been
                  developed to diminish nutrient deficiencies in
                  plant-based foods (SWOT analysis) and a summary of
                  the gene families involved in the mineral nutrient
                  pathways. Finally, it also discusses how `omics'
                  techniques can be used in genetic engineering
                  programs to increase mineral levels and
                  bioavailability in the most important staple food
                  crops and the socioeconomic implications of
                  plant-based biofortified foods. },

  Abstract =     {National Sample Survey data on the unit values of a
                  large number of foods can be used to compute price
                  index numbers that can be compared with the official
                  national price indices, the Consumer Price Index for
                  Agricultural Labourers for rural India, and the
                  Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers for
                  urban India. This paper finds that over the five
                  years from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, the food component
                  of the cpial understated the rate of food price
                  inflation. This understatement can be attributed to
                  the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and
                  the resultant over-weighting of cereals, whose
                  prices fell relative to other foods. The overall
                  weight of food in the cpial is also too large, so
                  that the growth in the general cpial was understated
                  during this period when food prices fell relative to
                  non-food prices. Under conservative assumptions, the
                  paper calculates that the five-year growth in the
                  reported cpial of 10.6 per cent should have been
                  14.3 per cent. The nominal poverty lines are also
                  understated. As a result, and ignoring other
                  problems with the counts, the official poverty ratio
                  of 28.3 per cent for rural India in 2004-05 should
                  be closer to 31 per cent; at current rates of rural
                  poverty reduction, this eliminates more than three
                  years of progress.},

                  research results are: (1) income benefits from canal
                  waters prima facie were more than the supply cost of
                  such waters throughout the period 1980-81 to 1992-93
                  and (2) the supply cost of canal irrigation tended
                  to rise much faster than the income benefits,
                  probably because hidden costs of corruption and
                  sheer inefficiencies in canal development and
                  administration soared in the above period of general
                  erosion in ethics and public accountability. },

  Abstract =     {B D Dhawan Official statistics indicate a rather
                  confusing picture of groundwater exploitation in
                  {I}ndia. As per the irrigated area figures of the
                  Planning Commission, development of groundwater
                  irrigation has reached disturbing levels in many
                  states, notably UP. Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil
                  Nadu. But the less known volumetric statistics in
                  respect of groundwater irrigation compiled at the
                  behest of the Central Groundwater Board are rather
                  reassuring. Barring a dozen districts of the West
                  Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to
                  have reached the danger mark of groundwater
                  over-exploitation. The reality is somewhere between
                  these extremes, more likely nearer to the Board's
                  than the Commission's assessment. },

  Abstract =     {Reassessment of Irrigation Potential B D Dhawan THAT
                  there was something amiss with our statistics of
                  irrigation potential, developed over the plans
                  through public, private and institutional
                  investments, arose time and again during the course
                  of innumerable probings by academic persons into the
                  problem of underutilisation of irrigation capacity
                  in {I}ndia. Misgivings about their being on the high
                  side were reinforced whenever the reported estimates
                  of irrigation potential utilised were compared by
                  some scholars with data from alternative
                  sources. For example, these estimates have tended to
                  exceed the levels based on our agricultural land
                  records. At the end of the Sixth Five- Ycar Plan (i
                  e, 1984-85), the national plan figure of gross
                  irrigated area was placed at 60.58 mha, almost 6 mha
                  more than the corresponding figure of 54.67 mha as
                  per the compilation from land utilisation
                  records. More up-to-date comparison is not possible
                  because data from land record sources are available
                  with a lag of 4-5 year period. In viewof this lag
                  planners are forced to rely on data in respect of
                  plan achievements (in respect of irrigation
                  potential created and utilised) as per the reports
                  of the states which in turn, go by the claims made
                  in this regard by their irrigation departments
                  manned mostly by engineers. },

                  Discussion about the impact of the New Economic
                  Policy only casually refers to agricultural
                  labourers and their wages. Further, the methods of
                  wage data collection seem to have attracted
                  negligible attention of researchers and the
                  government agencies collecting and publishing such
                  data. The attitude of indifference also gets
                  reflected in the manner the problem of minimum wage
                  determination is handled. Though the labour unions
                  have done commendable work on this issue, they have
                  not been able to get a proper minimum wage
                  determined. Therefore, understanding various sources
                  of wage data and their respective methods of
                  collection is important to get qualitatively
                  reliable data. },

  Abstract =     {Evaluating the effectiveness of the "targeting"
                  approach in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, the
                  present study examines the determinants of
                  enrolment, hospitalisation and financial protection
                  for below the poverty line households using data
                  from a large-scale survey conducted in Maharashtra
                  in 2012-13. Almost 50% of BPL households were found
                  to be non-poor and only 30% of them were aware about
                  RSBY. More importantly, the effect of RSBY on
                  catastrophic health expenditure was not found to be
                  statistically significant. Since commercial
                  insurance companies and their third party
                  administrators have limited interest in awareness
                  generation and enrolment, their role may be reviewed
                  and instead an independent public agency should be
                  given responsibility for enrolment of unorganised
                  sector workers. This would be a key step towards
                  achieving universal population coverage. However, in
                  the long run, the government should strengthen the
                  resource-starved public health system.},

                  the {I}ndian census has been severely underutilised
                  in this regard, and also offers a view on the issues

  Abstract =     {Any discussion on universal health coverage in India
                  is premature without a comprehensive understanding
                  of public financing of health coverage in the
                  country. This article analyses the government's
                  share of financial resources for health across
                  different agents, with particular focus on resources
                  for health coverage. An attempt is made to separate
                  spending for health in general and health coverage
                  in particular, and to examine the issue of
                  equity. The analysis indicates that the present
                  health coverage system is inadequate and iniquitous,
                  with various systems running at different costs. It
                  suggests consolidating finances and moving towards a
                  more unified system to realise the benefits of
                  efficiency gains.},

  Abstract =     {This paper re-examines the trends in employment and
                  unemployment as thrown up by successive National
                  Sample Surveys from the mid-1970s. The analysis
                  suggests that the euphoria about high employment
                  growth during 1999-2004 was not justified nor does
                  the concern about jobless growth in the subsequent
                  years capture the changes in employment structure. A
                  long-term analysis of employment trends reveals that
                  changes in the employment pattern and workforce
                  structure have been sluggish and do not conform to
                  the standard employment-output relationship. The
                  analysis also flags certain issues which have a
                  bearing on the comparability of employment data
                  before and after 1993-94. Large fluctuations seen
                  after 1993-94 appear to be a result of the movement
                  in and out of labour force of a substantial section
                  of the population which is vulnerable and in the
                  informal sector in a phase of rising overall rates
                  of economic growth. The paper concludes with a brief
                  discussion of the results of the recently released
                  2009-10 survey.},

  Abstract =     {This paper, in two parts, reports an evaluation of
                  existing in-kind food transfers. Part I outlines the
                  dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer
                  content and physical leakages, and deals with the
                  impact of these transfers on poverty as officially
                  measured. Part II reports the impact of these
                  transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some
                  issues regarding the financial cost of these
                  transfers. Contrary to the view that food
                  self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the
                  need for direct food interventions, the paper
                  reports a significant increase in contribution of
                  in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and
                  nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact
                  is attributable to improved public distribution
                  system efficiency. The first part, presented here,
                  was motivated by some issues that arose in the
                  context of the Tendulkar method of estimating
                  poverty as regards its treatment of food
                  prices. This method treats food prices differently
                  from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive
                  to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper
                  suggests a decomposition method that modifies the
                  Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between
                  household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers
                  received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty
                  reducing impact of these food transfers is found to
                  have increased over time and is more pronounced in
                  the case of distribution-sensitive measures of
                  poverty. },

                  on nutritional intake as measured by
                  calories. Econometric analysis using a simple
                  calorie demand function confirms the significance of
                  variables relating to public distribution system
                  access, controlling for other covariates, in its
                  contribution to calorie intake. Results also suggest
                  that the calorie-elasticity of PDS transfers is
                  twice as large compared to additional out-of-pocket
                  income equal to the cash equivalent of PDS
                  transfers. These are also confirmed by
                  non-parametric analysis of calorie intake of various
                  consumer groups. Although preliminary, these results
                  suggest caution in advocating cash transfers as
                  substitute of in-kind transfers. Finally, the paper
                  evaluates concerns about the financial implications
                  of the minimum support price-PDS system in light of
                  the recently enacted National Food Security Act. },

  Abstract =     {Trends in employment and unemployment in India, as
                  presented by the quinquennial surveys of the
                  National Sample Survey Office for the past decades,
                  have raised many questions for which there are no
                  easy answers. This paper attempts to address some
                  missing links. With the help of time use statistics,
                  it argues that the missing labour force does not
                  imply withdrawal of women (and maybe some men) from
                  the labour market. A large part of the missing
                  labour is missing only from the NSSO data but is
                  very much there in the labour force - though a small
                  part may be due to withdrawal. It appears "missing"
                  because of the inability of the NSSO surveys to
                  capture it adequately. This "non-missing labour
                  force" has important implications for the employment
                  and labour policy in the country. The paper also
                  argues that time use statistics has the potential of
                  overcoming some weaknesses of the NSSO as well as of
                  adding new information on the labour force.},

  Abstract =     {This paper presents a sketch of the key findings of
                  a research project on Gender and Migration at the
                  Centre for Women&#39;s Development Studies. The
                  results of a series of primary surveys conducted
                  between 2009 and 2011 across 20 states have been
                  consolidated to present a summary meso-level view of
                  types of migration, patterns of female labour
                  migration, conditions of work and civic life of
                  women migrant workers. The sectoral composition of
                  paid migrant workers based on the latest available
                  migration survey by the National Sample Survey
                  Office is presented for contextual background,
                  alongside a critical interrogation of the official
                  data's gender insensitive concepts. Rising rates of
                  marriage migration juxtaposed against falling female
                  work participation rates and the spread of dowry are
                  also touched upon. },

  Abstract =     {This paper attempts to understand the processes of
                  growth in rural non-farm employment based on the
                  2009-10 employment and unemployment round of the
                  National Sample Survey Office. The rural non-farm
                  sector has undergone major restructuring which has
                  led to an increase in the share of casual labour in
                  the non-farm sector accompanied by a continuous
                  decline in the share of self and regular
                  employment. On the basis of multivariate analyses at
                  two levels, this study concludes that though
                  non-farm employment in rural areas is primarily
                  distress-driven, there are some significant entry
                  barriers for rural workers in the nonfarm sector in
                  terms of education, age and gender. Considering the
                  overall deceleration of rural employment until
                  2009-10, the paper emphasises the importance of
                  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
                  Scheme in rural employment generation and the
                  consequent process of feminisation of casual
                  workforce in the non-farm sector that has emerged in
                  the last five years. The results indicate the crisis
                  of joblessness would have been more acute without
                  the scheme. The overall quality of rural employment,
                  driven by distress factors, has deteriorated in
                  2009-10 over 2004-05 in a significant way. },

                  Education Act, 2009 promises free and compulsory
                  education to all children in the age group of 6-14
                  years. But the way this critical entitlement is
                  being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart
                  from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of
                  the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued
                  the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is
                  aimed at ushering in quality elementary education
                  for all. The problems are many, and this paper
                  observes that most of them can be connected to
                  inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of
                  ensuring that the Act&#39;s aims are fulfilled is to
                  bring in a common school system based on
                  neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering
                  variety of indifferent institutions we now have. },

                  Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest
                  Rights) Act, 2006 has created controversy in West
                  Bengal. The gram sabha, the basic unit in the
                  process of forest rights recognition, has been
                  replaced by the gram sansad, denoting the village
                  level constituency under the panchayati raj
                  system. This has been followed by contiguous
                  arrangements as well as initiatives which are
                  inconsistent with the Act. All these factors have
                  led to undermining the spirit of the Act to promote
                  community governance of forests, which has invoked
                  stiff opposition from forest dwellers in the region.

                  some plausible explanatory variables. This study is
                  based on rural wage data taken from various rounds
                  of the National Sample Survey and mainly focuses on
                  the level and trend in wages during the first decade
                  of 21st century. It makes an attempt to identify
                  several variables that could explain the observed
                  variations among Indian states in levels and trends
                  during this period. },

  Abstract =     {The inadequate availability of drinking water and
                  proper sanitation, especially in rural India, leads
                  to innumerable deadly diseases, harms the
                  environment, and also affects vulnerable
                  populations, such as persons with disabilities and
                  women, exposing them to sexual violence. Providing
                  access to sanitation facilities in rural areas of
                  India has been on the agenda of the Government of
                  India for the past three decades. However, a
                  reinvigorated thrust to provide adequate sanitation
                  facilities in rural India is the need of the hour,
                  which must be accompanied by constant scrutiny and
                  monitoring, so as to arrive at apt decisions and
                  policies for further action. },

                  strategies employed by privately-owned companies to
                  gain access to land for resource extraction in
                  Jharkhand where much of the land being put under the
                  shovel is inalienable adivasi or tribal land and
                  deedless commons. It concludes that although policy
                  reforms are welcome, cosmetic changes in mineral
                  governance laws are inadequate to protect the
                  interests of the poor. It suggests an alternative
                  vision, a complete overhaul of mineral ownership to
                  allow the poor to share the revenue benefits.},

  Abstract =     {Using 2009-10 National Sample Survey data, this
                  paper describes patterns of job-seeking, rationing,
                  and participation in the Mahatma Gandhi National
                  Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. At the national
                  level, it finds that the self-targeting design of
                  MGNREGS leads to greater rates of self-selection
                  into the programme by poorer and scheduled tribe or
                  scheduled caste households. However, the
                  administrative rationing of MGNREGS jobs is not
                  pro-poor but exhibits a sort of middle-class
                  bias. At the state level, roughly half of 27 states
                  exhibit rationing and participation profiles that
                  signal effective pro-poor targeting; the other half
                  struggle to avoid high rates and regressive patterns
                  of administrative rationing of jobs to which the
                  poor have a legal right. },

                  additional tool to combat micronutrient
                  malnutrition. This paper estimates the costs and
                  potential benefits of biofortification of globally
                  important staple food crops with provitamin A, iron,
                  and zinc for twelve countries in Africa, Asia, and
                  Latin America. Using a modification of the
                  Disability-Adjusted Life Years framework we conclude
                  that overall, the intervention can make a
                  significant impact on the burden of micronutrient
                  deficiencies in the developing world in a highly
                  cost-effective manner. Results differ by crop,
                  micronutrient, and country; and major reasons
                  underlying these differences are identified to
                  inform policy. },

  Abstract =     {India witnessed a widening of income inequality
                  during the phase of acceleration in economic growth
                  in the post-reform period (1993-94 to 2004-05). This
                  paper analyses the issue by using different types of
                  inequality measurements like general entropy
                  indices, kernel density graphs, percentile of income
                  graphs and field decomposition. It finds two major
                  features of a rising inequality in urban areas: (a)
                  even with a doubling of per capita consumption
                  growth in the post-reform decade, the decline in
                  poverty was less by a quarter compared to the
                  pre-reform decade, and (b) in the post-reform
                  period, the growth of the wage rate of regular
                  workers was negative up to the 50th percentile of
                  wage earnings, and beyond that point, wage rate
                  growth turned positive and rose sharply to reach 5\%
                  per annum in highest quintile of wage earnings. },

                  disadvantaged in respect to land, which largely
                  accounts for their perpetual poverty and makes them
                  vulnerable to injustice and exploitation, attempts
                  have been made by the union and state governments to
                  promote and protect their rights with regard to the
                  control and use of land. Based on 13 major states,
                  the present study shows that even after 50 years of
                  planned initiatives and policy measures, there has
                  not been substantial improvement in the landholding
                  status of scheduled groups, and in some states, it
                  has declined further.},

  Volume =       36,
  Abstract =     {Public distribution of foodgrains in India is a
                  national policy, which exists in all states. In some
                  states, however, the public distribution system
                  (PDS) works much better than in other states. The
                  undivided state of Bihar (now the new Bihar and
                  Jharkhand) is one of the states in which the policy
                  works poorly. It is important to understand why this
                  is the case. Generally, policy changes and
                  recommendations do not take the specificities of
                  particular states into account. Yet, for the PDS
                  performance to improve in Bihar and Jharkhand, it is
                  absolutely necessary to understand why it works as
                  it does, what the main bottlenecks are and where
                  there are possibilities for improvement, if
                  any. This paper makes such an attempt: it describes
                  the PDS in Bihar and Jharkhand, not only in terms of
                  how it fails and what it does not accomplish, but
                  also in terms of what it is and what it does. It is
                  shown that while many people do benefit from the
                  present set-up, there are also people within almost
                  all categories of stakeholders who are dissatisfied
                  with the large-scale misappropriation of
                  foodgrains. It is argued that there is scope for
                  change, but change requires strategic political
                  manoeuvring and initially a low-key approach in
                  order not to awaken and antagonise strong vested
                  interests.},

                  censuses conducted by the Ministry of Water
                  Resources between 1986-87 and 2006-07, this paper
                  points out that {I}ndia&#39;s groundwater sector has
                  slowed down since 2000-01, most markedly in eastern
                  {I}ndia. It examines the reasons for this and also
                  looks into how farmers have been responding to
                  lowered groundwater tables. Besides identifying some
                  factors that have not changed since the mid-1980s,
                  it emphasises that there are wide regional
                  variations in the country&#39;s groundwater economy
                  and management strategies need to be crafted
                  accordingly. },

                  and investment information on a regular and reliable

                  response to industrial change and a variety of
                  policy initiatives. This problem needs to be

                  Aarogyasri Scheme in undivided Andhra Pradesh during
                  2007, which was meant to protect poor families from
                  catastrophic inpatient health expenses, no reliable
                  data is available to assess out-of-pocket health
                  payments in the state. The latest data available is
                  from the last round of a health survey by the
                  National Sample Survey Office in 2004-05. This study
                  estimates the OOP health expenditure in Andhra
                  Pradesh in 2012-13, and provides estimates for the
                  year&#39;s from 2004-05 onwards. The paper points
                  out that the need is to formulate a state health
                  policy, which, among other things, targets a
                  government health expenditure to total health
                  expenditure ratio of 0.8. },

                  comparison of the consumption expenditure and
                  associated nutritional intake data for 2009-10 with
                  that of 2004-05 shows worsening poverty in terms of
                  the percentage of people unable to reach the minimum
                  required calories energy intake through their
                  monthly spending on all goods and services. This
                  result must be seen in the context of neo-liberal
                  policy, the financial crisis and consequent global
                  recession affecting export production, the rapid
                  rise in food prices, declining employment growth,
                  the drought of 2009-10, and in spite of a positive
                  development like the National Rural Employment
                  Guarantee Scheme. It is argued that the decline
                  claimed in the official poverty ratios is spurious.

  Abstract =     {This paper argues that a very considerable
                  difference is made to the behaviour of farm
                  variables with changing economic size of farms (i e,
                  changing scale of production), depending on how we
                  measure this economic size. With acreage as the
                  measure of economic size, i e, of the scale of
                  production, we obtain one set of results; with an
                  alternative index of the scale of production, we may
                  obtain diametrically opposite results. Further, in a
                  situation of changing techniques, as at present, the
                  grouping of farm data by acreage is likely to
                  obscure some very important features of the dynamics
                  of agricultural change. We propose to illustrate the
                  argument with data on farm economics collected by us
                  as part of a study of the growth of capitalist
                  farming from 66 large farms scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states in 1969. [The author would

  Abstract =     {In recent years there has emerged a tendency towards
                  profit-oriented production and investment in land by
                  a section of the cultivating population. Many
                  observers think they see a new class of capitalist
                  farmers emerging. There had been, however, no
                  quantitative studies attempting to isolate the
                  characteristics of capitalist farmers or to apply
                  any criteria to identify the capitalists. Ashok
                  Rudra with A Majid and B D Talib carried out a
                  sample survey of big farmers in Punjab and, after
                  attempting to isolate the capitalists from the
                  sample by certain statistical methods, came to the
                  conclusion that no group of capitalist farmers could
                  be identified. The author conducted a small survey
                  in 1969 of 66 big farmers scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states. The aim was to concentrate on
                  detailed case studies of big farmers selected
                  purposively with a wide geographical scatter. The
                  results of the survey show that a new class of
                  capitalist farmers is emerging. This is a phenomenon
                  common to every region, insofar as every area has
                  been subject to the same forces - albeit operating
                  with varying intensity - of an expanding market and
                  enhanced profitability of agricultural
                  production. The rate at which capitalist development
                  is occurring varies widely in different regions
                  depending on many historical and current
                  circumstances; it may be near zero in some: but the
                  reality of the process cannot be denied.},

  Abstract =     {This paper estimates and compares the paid-out cost
                  of cultivation of wheat in {I}ndia, the most
                  state-protected crop, during the input subsidy
                  regime of the 1970s and 1980s and after its
                  abolition in the 1990s, when economic reforms were
                  initiated. The study uses the valuable time series
                  information collected as part of the "comprehensive
                  scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After
                  surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well
                  as costs of cultivation vis-{\`{a}}-vis the
                  wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price
                  level), the value of inputs which are exclusively
                  market-purchased are analysed. A study of the
                  weighted average of these costs establishes
                  unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs
                  increased very sharply in the post-reform period.},

  Abstract =     {of "Intermediate Regimes" IN a paper published in
                  1964, Kalecki used the term "intermediate regimes"
                  to describe governments in which the lower-middle
                  class and the rich peasantry could be identified as
                  performing the role of the ruling class.1 In the
                  past, he observed, whenever social up- heavels
                  brought their representatives to power they had
                  invariably served the interests of big business
                  often allied with the remnants of the feudal
                  system. However, certain conditions had emerged
                  recently in many underdeveloped countries which made
                  it possible for them to play a different role. The
                  specific conditions he cited were: the numerical
                  dominance of the lower middle class at the time of
                  achievement of the political independence of these
                  countries, the extensive involvement of governments
                  in economic activity, and the availability to; them
                  of credits from socialist countries. Given these
                  conditions, the state could, in his view, perform
                  the role of 'dynamic entrepreneurs', undertake the
                  basic investment necessary for economic development,
                  and promote "a pattern of amalgamation of the
                  interests of the lower middle class with state
                  capitalism.},

  Author =       {Ramakumar, R.},
  Journal =      {IDS Bulletin},
  Year =         2012,
  Pages =        {92-103},
  Volume =       43,
  Abstract =     {Public investment in agriculture has significant
                  poverty-reducing effects. This article attempts to
                  analyse trends in agricultural investments in
                  {I}ndia between the 1950s and the 2000s. It argues
                  that public investment and expenditure on
                  agriculture in {I}ndia have grown only slowly and
                  have not decisively increased even after more than
                  60 years of independence. While public capital
                  formation and expenditure do show a moderate rise in
                  the 2000s, a revival of {I}ndia's agricultural
                  growth requires a far greater thrust to public
                  spending. Major and medium irrigation projects
                  require special attention, as irrigation is
                  instrumental not just in raising yields, but also
                  the number of days of employment for
                  labourers. Increasing public investment in
                  agricultural research and extension is central to
                  bridging the yield gap that persists. Formal credit
                  flows to agriculture have to specifically target
                  small and marginal farmers, and emphasis should move
                  away from generating agricultural growth by
                  channelling credit to agri-business firms and
                  corporate players in agriculture. If {I}ndia's
                  second green revolution has to contribute to an
                  accelerated reduction of poverty, hunger and
                  malnourishment, it undoubtedly has to be a state-led
                  project.},

                  in selected areas of Jharkhand's Dumka
                  district. While inadequate infrastructure and the
                  lack of teachers affect the quality of teaching,
                  poverty is responsible for the alarming rates of
                  non-enrolment, dropouts and poor attendance of
                  pupils. Scheduled tribe children are particularly at
                  a disadvantage as education is not imparted in their
                  mother tongue. The state of primary education, as
                  this paper suggests, needs a multi-pronged effort to
                  ensure its greater effectiveness. While the
                  government can step in with incentives such as
                  midday meal schemes, community participation in the
                  governance of the primary schooling system has to be
                  ensured.},

                  commercialisation, export orientation and market
                  development in agriculture and industry, has meant
                  that acquisition of land has become a priority state
                  concern with little effort being made to prevent
                  tribal land alienation or ensure food security in
                  the state.},

                  enrolment for education? (3) What is the economic
                  status of those who dropped out of the labour force

                  Organisation has been portrayed as
                  &quot;short-sighted&quot;. If truth be told,
                  long-pending proposals for reforming the Agreement
                  on Agriculture were being sidelined, while
                  interested parties were pushing ahead with the new
                  agenda on trade facilitation. A clearer
                  understanding of the issues in agriculture vs the
                  issues in trade facilitation would enable a better
                  appreciation of what is at stake. },

  Abstract =     {This paper analyses National Sample survey data on
                  changes in the distribution of operational holdings
                  of land, using data from NSS surveys on employment
                  and unemployment. The paper discusses the
                  limitations of these statistics in some detail. Four
                  main points emerge from the analysis: there has been
                  a sharp rise in landlessness in rural {I}ndia; caste
                  disparities in access to land have persisted over
                  time; there has been a rise in inequality in
                  distribution of land cultivated by households; and
                  there has been a decline in the proportion of manual
                  labour households that combined wage labour with
                  cultivation of small holdings. Finally, statistics
                  on land distribution at the State level reveal some
                  puzzling features -- some of which point to possible
                  errors in data collection.},

                  of data on irrigation. Collection of data on
                  different types of irrigation systems in the state
                  has been left to different agencies. These agencies
                  are not geared to systematic collection of
                  statistics and the data provided by them are not
                  regular and are often inconsistent. As a result, no
                  reliable statistics exist that could be used to
                  identify patterns of irrigation at the state-level -
                  leave aside doing such exercises at district, block
                  or village levels - with a level of accuracy that is
                  possible for some of the other states. This paper
                  provides an overview of the different sources of
                  data on irrigation in West Bengal and discusses the

                  quintiles and the frequency distribution of
                  households across income levels in different social
                  groups. We then estimate a standard GE(2) inequality
                  index along with its decomposition by caste. Lastly,
                  we compute an alternative benchmark for assessing
                  the share of between-group inequality in total
                  inequality as suggested by Elbers, Lanjouw,
                  Mistiaen, and Ozler (ELMO 2008). Our analysis shows
                  high levels of income inequality between households
                  of different caste groups.},

  Abstract =     {Increased micronutrient density in grain destined
                  for human consumption may alleviate micronutrient
                  deficiencies (Fe, Zn, Cu, and I) in human
                  populations around the world. The review of
                  literature indicates that fertilization with
                  inorganic and organic forms of micronutrients has a
                  potential to increase their concentrations in
                  grain. The most effective fertilization could be via
                  soil (for Zn and, to some extent, Cu), foliarly (for
                  Fe) and by adding fertilizers to the irrigation
                  water (for iodine). Care should be exercised not to
                  overfertilize crops with micronutrients because of
                  consequent toxicity and losses in quality and
                  quantity of grain yield. Effectiveness of various
                  agricultural measures in increasing micronutrient
                  density depends on soil type, crop, cultivar,
                  rotation, and environmental and other factors, thus
                  necessitating development of a specific set of
                  measures for individual regions. Agricultural
                  measures would need to be supplemented with
                  appropriate changes in the milling technology to
                  ascertain that increased micronutrient
                  concentrations in some grain parts are passed into
                  the food chain. },

  Abstract =     {Biofortification, the process of breeding nutrients
                  into food crops, provides a sustainable, long-term
                  strategy for delivering micronutrients to rural
                  populations in developing countries. Crops are being
                  bred for higher levels of micronutrients using both
                  conventional and transgenic breeding methods;
                  several conventional varieties have been released,
                  while additional conventional and transgenic
                  varieties are in the breeding pipeline. The results
                  of efficacy and effectiveness studies, as well as
                  recent successes in delivery, provide evidence that
                  biofortification is a promising strategy for
                  combating hidden hunger. This review highlights
                  progress to date and identifies challenges faced in
                  delivering biofortified crops. },

  Abstract =     {The 55th round (1999-2000) of the NSS used a
                  different methodology from all previous rounds and
                  arrived at lower poverty estimates. The consensus
                  from earlier NSS rounds, that poverty reduction had
                  been set back during the 1990s, was challenged by
                  this data. This was bolstered by some 'adjustments',
                  which although agreeing that the 55th round had
                  overestimated poverty reduction, claimed that the
                  number of poor had nonetheless fallen by 30-45
                  million. However, a detailed re-examination shows
                  that these 'adjustments' were not correct. The
                  poverty ratio fell at most by 3 percentage points
                  between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, and it is likely that
                  the number of poor increased over this period. The
                  main lesson is that poverty estimates are very
                  sensitive to both survey design and post-survey
                  analysis. The first of a two-part article.},

                  Survey 2011-12 (68th round) reveal that over nine
                  million persons found employment between 2009-10 and
                  2011-12. This was characterised by some sections of
                  the media as a &quot;rebound&quot; from the
                  stagnancy between 2004-05 and 2009-10. However, our
                  analysis shows that the average growth in employment
                  between 2004-05 and 2011-12 remains low at 2.5
                  million per year. The findings also reveal that a

                  non-farm activities, and a falling proportion is
                  engaged on a casual wage. },

                  2050 may seem like a big enough challenge in itself,
                  but we also need to achieve this feat whilst, at the
                  same time, reducing adverse impacts of food
                  production on a whole range of ecosystem
                  services. One suggested response is ``sustainable
                  intensification'' which entails delivering safer,
                  nutritious food from the same area whilst
                  maintaining ecosystem service provision. In this
                  review, I examine sustainable intensification and
                  consider alternatives such as management of food
                  demand and waste reduction. I conclude that
                  sustainable intensification has a role to play, but
                  this must be accompanied by fundamental change in
                  global food systems. },

                  insurance for poor families is the method chosen for
                  attaining this objective. The Rashtriya Swasthya
                  Bima Yojana was rolled out in 2008 for households
                  below the poverty line, enabling them to access
                  health services in the public and private
                  sectors. However, experience from different
                  countries shows tax-funded insurance systems work
                  well only in settings where public provisioning of
                  healthcare services prevails. State-funded targeted
                  insurance schemes do not seriously mitigate
                  inequitable access to health services in a
                  fundamentally private healthcare delivery market.},

  Abstract =     {About 805 million people - one in nine people
                  worldwide - remain chronically hungry. Ending hunger
                  and malnutrition requires strong political
                  commitment at the highest level, effective
                  coordination among various ministries and partners,
                  and broad-based social participation. Three policy
                  priorities are crucial to ending malnutrition -
                  expansion of social protection; making smallholder
                  agriculture more nutrition sensitive; and focusing
                  on under-fi ve child and maternal nutrition defi
                  ciencies. An integrated approach is needed to ensure
                  that food consumed is nutritious, wholesome,
                  acceptable, safe and affordable, especially to the
                  poorest and most vulnerable.},

                  results from a detailed survey of farm business
                  incomes show that Bt cotton was a clear leader in
                  terms of production and gross value of output when
                  grown as a stand-alone crop. However, on the fields
                  of small and marginal farmers, where cotton was
                  usually intercropped with sorghum (or other cereals
                  and pulses), the relative income advantage of Bt
                  cotton declined. Further, expenditure on chemical
                  pesticides was higher for Bt cotton than for other
                  varieties of cotton. Variability in production was
                  also higher for Bt cotton than for other types of
                  cotton.},

                  in size, the labour force is shifting away from

                  also seeking better-quality non-agricultural
                  jobs. However, the trends between 2004-05 and
                  2011-12 indicate that employment generation in the
                  country has been inadequate to meet this
                  challenge. Construction has virtually become the
                  only source of incremental employment in rural
                  {I}ndia. In the urban areas, men have been able to
                  obtain a disproportionate share of high-productivity

  Abstract =     {The growth of gross domestic product in every
                  sub-sector of the {I}ndian economy accelerated
                  during the second half of the 2000s, compared to the
                  first half of the decade. However, employment growth
                  in most sectors except construction
                  decelerated. This jobless growth was partly the
                  result of positive changes such as the reduction of
                  &quot;distress employment&quot; in agriculture,
                  created during the previous half-decade, and an
                  expansion in the population of students. Rural wages
                  rose and average educational levels of the workforce
                  improved. Government interventions in rural {I}ndia
                  since the mid-2000s, particularly the Mahatma Gandhi
                  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, seemed to
                  have aided these positive transformations. However,
                  manufacturing employment in the country fell and
                  employment growth slowed down in most constituents
                  of the services sector. The new jobs generated were
                  predominantly in rural construction. The slow
                  progress in the diversification of {I}ndia&#39;s
                  employment structure has led to large-scale
                  withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the
                  number of women thus &quot;missing&quot; being as
                  large as the population of Brazil. },

                  perception of inequalities in 15 countries and
                  identifies various policy options in combating this
                  major development challenge of our time. The report
                  makes the basic point that in spite of the
                  impressive progress humanity has made on many fronts
                  over the decades, it still remains deeply
                  divided. In that context, it is intended to help
                  development actors, citizens, and policy makers
                  contribute to global dialogues and initiate
                  conversations in their own countries about the
                  drivers and extent of inequalities, their impact,

  Abstract =     {Micronutrient malnutrition (`Hidden Hunger') now
                  afflicts over two billion people worldwide,
                  resulting in poor health, low worker productivity,
                  high rates of mortality and morbidity, increased
                  rates of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease,
                  cancer, stroke, and diabetes), and permanent
                  impairment of cognitive abilities of infants born to
                  micronutrient-deficient mothers. The consequences of
                  food system failures include lethargic national
                  development efforts, continued high population
                  growth rates, and a vicious cycle of poverty for
                  massive numbers of underprivileged people in all
                  nations. Our food systems are failing us globally by
                  not providing enough balanced nutrient output to
                  meet all the nutritional needs of every person,
                  especially resource-poor women, infants and children
                  in developing countries. Agriculture is partly
                  responsible because it has never held nutrient
                  output as an explicit goal of its production
                  systems. Indeed, many agricultural policies have
                  fostered a decline in nutrition and diet diversity
                  for the poor in many countries. Nutrition and health
                  communities are also partly responsible because they
                  have never considered using agriculture as a primary
                  tool in their programs directed at alleviating poor
                  nutrition and ill health globally. Now is the time
                  for a new paradigm for agriculture and nutrition. We
                  must consider ways in which agriculture can
                  contribute to finding sustainable solutions to food
                  system failures through holistic food-based system
                  approaches, thereby closely linking agricultural
                  production to improving human health, livelihood and
                  well being. Such action will stimulate support for
                  agricultural research in many developed countries
                  because it addresses consumer issues as well as
                  agricultural production issues and is, therefore,
                  politically supportable. },

  Volume =       {19},
  Abstract =     {Even mild to moderate vitamin A deficiency is now
                  recognized as an important factor in child health
                  and survival. This has given increased emphasis to
                  the goal of virtually eliminating vitamin A
                  deficiency and its consequences, including
                  blindness, by the end of the decade. The
                  implications of vitamin A deficiency, however, vary
                  according to the group at risk, and this needs to be
                  addressed when looking at ways to achieve the
                  goal. In pre-school children, vitamin A deficiency
                  can lead to increased risk of mortality and
                  morbidity and to blindness. In pregnant and
                  lactating women, it can lead to night-blindness and
                  appears to have implications for maternal morbidity
                  and mortality. Although the immediate health
                  consequences for schoolchildren and adolescents are
                  not completely known, they are probably less
                  dramatic. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is a
                  cross-generational cycle leading to and perpetuating
                  vitamin A deficiency in affected communities. This
                  also has implications when addressing prevention and
                  control strategies. The existing, somewhat
                  successful approach has been to target children aged
                  six months to six years; it is implicit that this
                  criterion is used to measure progress towards the
                  end-of-decade goals. A broader, complementary,
                  life-cycle approach to vitamin A deficiency is now
                  appropriate in many countries. There is increasing
                  emphasis on such approaches, i.e., fortifying foods
                  with vitamin A and improving the diet, which address
                  the whole population at risk. A mix of interventions
                  will give governments the chance to shift from a
                  subsidized vitamin A capsule programme to more
                  sustainable, non-subsidized, consumer-funded vitamin
                  A interventions, although in an appreciable number
                  of countries, supplementation with vitamin A will be
                  a necessity for some years to come. Guidelines to
                  assist governments in such transitions are a high
                  priority.},

  Abstract =     {Over 2,000 million people, or more than one of three
                  individuals throughout the world, are at risk for
                  iron, vitamin A, or iodine deficiency. The three
                  main approaches to addressing micronutrient
                  deficiencies are fortification, supplementation, and
                  dietary diversification. Although fortification of
                  staple foods has played a significant role in the
                  nutritional well-being and health of the more
                  industrialized nations, it has not been considered
                  an option for less developed countries because of
                  the lack of centrally processed foods and poorly
                  developed food-marketing systems.  As food markets
                  expand, however, fortification options are becoming
                  increasingly available. This paper identifies past
                  and present successes and failures, as well as the
                  facilitating factors and constraints that need to be
                  addressed. Based on recent experience and the
                  lessons learned, successful programmes require at
                  least the following: political will and support and
                  the willingness to legislate or regulate;
                  private-sector involvement; public-sector support;
                  willingness of both sectors to enforce quality
                  assurance programmes; good data on consumption
                  patterns; social acceptability of fortified food,
                  implying no change in organoleptic properties; and
                  minimal change in cost.},

  Abstract                 = {The Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) International Conference on Nutrition (ICN), held in Rome in December 1992, recognized the widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in developing countries. The conference recognized food-based
approaches as the most effective way to address existing micronutrient deficiencies. These approaches must include appropriate strategies to assure dietary diversification, improved food availability, food preservation, nutrition education, and food fortification.<br></br> The final report of the
conference included strategies and actions for preventing and controlling specific micronutrient deficiencies. It was proposed to ensure and legislate the fortification of foods or water with necessary micronutrients, where possible, when existing supplies fail to provide adequate levels in
the diet. Food fortification has been successfully used in both developed and developing countries as one strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies.<br></br> The primary purposes of food legislation are to protect the health of the consumer, protect the consumer from fraud, and facilitate
trade. In the case of fortified foods, the target population must be protected from receiving either toxic or nutritionally ineffective levels of micronutrients. Legislation may be necessary to require adequate control over this fortification process by the food processors to ensure that levels
of micronutrients are consistently within acceptable limits. Legislation may also be required to prohibit the addition of nutrients to commodities where it is nutritionally unnecessary or unsafe or where fortification may create an erroneous impression as to the nutritional value of the food.<br></br>
Any legislation regarding food fortification should incorporate the standards, recommendations, and guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) and the WTO Agreement on Technical
Barriers to Trade (the TBT Agreement) have placed new importance on Codex standards, guidelines, codes, and recommendations.},

  Abstract =     {The technology for fortifying sugar with vitamin A
                  was developed in Guatemala in the mid-1970s, and the
                  Guatemalan government enacted legislation to make
                  fortification mandatory in June 1974. This action
                  was copied by other Central American
                  governments. The fortification programme in
                  Guatemala developed in two stages. In the first
                  (1975-77), the fortification programme was evaluated
                  four times at six-month intervals and was shown to
                  be effective. The sugar industry was responsible for
                  carrying out the programme, but the programme was
                  suspended, mainly because of economic
                  arguments. After 10 years of effort, the programme
                  was restarted in 1989. At this time the programme
                  was combined with an initial mass distribution of
                  vitamin A capsules to pre-school children, which
                  began the first successful social mobilization
                  effort in the area. The programme was evaluated for
                  six months and was shown to be effective in
                  improving the vitamin A status of the Guatemalan
                  population. This sec- ond stage has been active
                  continuously since 1989. With improvements in the
                  technology of fortification, new approaches have
                  been tested, and now it is possible to obtain an
                  excellent sugar doubly fortified with vitamin A and
                  iron, using new iron products of high
                  bioavailability that do not alter the organoleptic
                  characteristics of the sugar and do not produce
                  unwanted colour changes during processing. To avoid
                  the rancidity of premixes, new processes of dry
                  mixing have been developed in which no oil is used,
                  This opens a real possibility for the fortification
                  of sugar with other nutrients. Sugar fortified with
                  vitamin A, iron, and zinc, either alone or in any
                  combination, is commercially available in Brazil,
                  where, under the guidance of the Latin American
                  Centre of Nutrition and Metabolic Studies (CELANEM),
                  the procedures have been developed using iron amino
                  acid chelated minerals.},

  Abstract                 = {The nutritional status of the population is one of the important factors determining the quality and productivity of the population, which in turn affects national productivity. In the long term, good nutritional status contributes to the intelligence and health of the population. Consequently,
programmes directed at improving the nutritional status of the population will undoubtedly be a high priority in the national development scheme of any country, developed or developing. Food fortification, i.e., the addition of nutrients to specific foods based on the dietary habits and nutritional
status of the target population, is one of the most popular nutritional interventions for improving the population's nutritional status. For food-fortification programmes to be successful, their technical aspects need to be carefully assessed. These include the nutritional justification for
food fortification, the acceptability of the fortified food product to consumers (both cost and taste), and any technical or analytical limitation to compliance with food regulations and labeling requirements. Important technical aspects of developing effective food-fortification programmes
are the choice of food carrier, nutrient interactions, bioavailability of nutrients, stability of nutrients added under anticipated conditions of storage and processing (food preparation at the household level), and safety. A good fortified product should not cause nutrition imbalance, and
excessive intake of nutrients should not have adverse effects. To provide better information for the consumer, the concept of overage should be introduced. Overage is the use of kinetic data on nutrient stability to calculate the amount of added nutrient so that the anticipated level of the
nutrient at the end of the product's shelf life is in accordance with the level indicated on the label.},  Timestamp                = {2015.03.01},

Brick kilns in India are a major destination for migrant labourers, who are tied to them for the production season after accepting advance wages from agents. Based on the livelihood conditions of the migrant labourers and their indebtedness, this paper points out these migrations have to be seen as forced. The labourers remain in inter-kiln circulation, but are prevented from moving on because of their limited skills and social networks. They return home to repay a never-ending debt and again receive advance wages for the next season--renewing a cycle of debt and migration for survival.

abstract = {This paper highlights the significant measurement issues in the computation of the prevalence of inadequate calorie intakes in India using NSS data. It focuses on the setting of appropriate norms or cutoffs which determine adequacy or inadequacy, as well as the measurement of intakes. Although energy norms for an individual are biologically determined their use as a policy tool necessitates several additional considerations that have not received sufficient attention in the literature. We demonstrate that changes in assumptions regarding age-sex distribution, average heights of adults, and physical activity status can lead to substantial changes in norms. Also important is the way food intakes are measured: changes in food habits that may lead to greater underreporting as the recall period increases, and the increasing trend, even though small, of eating meals outside the home, can exert a significant influence on the trends in the POU over time. With more realistic assumptions, the prevalence of inadequate energy intakes are quite reasonable in magnitude, although still high in absolute terms. The paper also suggests that by accounting for outliers, there is a correlation between anthropometric indicators for adults and food intakes.},
