@article{Rengel199927,
  Abstract =     {Increased micronutrient density in grain destined
                  for human consumption may alleviate micronutrient
                  deficiencies (Fe, Zn, Cu, and I) in human
                  populations around the world. The review of
                  literature indicates that fertilization with
                  inorganic and organic forms of micronutrients has a
                  potential to increase their concentrations in
                  grain. The most effective fertilization could be via
                  soil (for Zn and, to some extent, Cu), foliarly (for
                  Fe) and by adding fertilizers to the irrigation
                  water (for iodine). Care should be exercised not to
                  overfertilize crops with micronutrients because of
                  consequent toxicity and losses in quality and
                  quantity of grain yield. Effectiveness of various
                  agricultural measures in increasing micronutrient
                  density depends on soil type, crop, cultivar,
                  rotation, and environmental and other factors, thus
                  necessitating development of a specific set of
                  measures for individual regions. Agricultural
                  measures would need to be supplemented with
                  appropriate changes in the milling technology to
                  ascertain that increased micronutrient
                  concentrations in some grain parts are passed into
                  the food chain. },

@article{Welch19991,
  Abstract =     {Micronutrient malnutrition (`Hidden Hunger') now
                  afflicts over two billion people worldwide,
                  resulting in poor health, low worker productivity,
                  high rates of mortality and morbidity, increased
                  rates of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease,
                  cancer, stroke, and diabetes), and permanent
                  impairment of cognitive abilities of infants born to
                  micronutrient-deficient mothers. The consequences of
                  food system failures include lethargic national
                  development efforts, continued high population
                  growth rates, and a vicious cycle of poverty for
                  massive numbers of underprivileged people in all
                  nations. Our food systems are failing us globally by
                  not providing enough balanced nutrient output to
                  meet all the nutritional needs of every person,
                  especially resource-poor women, infants and children
                  in developing countries. Agriculture is partly
                  responsible because it has never held nutrient
                  output as an explicit goal of its production
                  systems. Indeed, many agricultural policies have
                  fostered a decline in nutrition and diet diversity
                  for the poor in many countries. Nutrition and health
                  communities are also partly responsible because they
                  have never considered using agriculture as a primary
                  tool in their programs directed at alleviating poor
                  nutrition and ill health globally. Now is the time
                  for a new paradigm for agriculture and nutrition. We
                  must consider ways in which agriculture can
                  contribute to finding sustainable solutions to food
                  system failures through holistic food-based system
                  approaches, thereby closely linking agricultural
                  production to improving human health, livelihood and
                  well being. Such action will stimulate support for
                  agricultural research in many developed countries
                  because it addresses consumer issues as well as
                  agricultural production issues and is, therefore,
                  politically supportable. },

                  Resources between 1986-87 and 2006-07, this paper
                  points out that {I}ndia&#39;s groundwater sector has
                  slowed down since 2000-01, most markedly in eastern
                  {I}ndia. It examines the reasons for this and also
                  looks into how farmers have been responding to
                  lowered groundwater tables. Besides identifying some
                  factors that have not changed since the mid-1980s,
                  it emphasises that there are wide regional
                  variations in the country&#39;s groundwater economy
                  and management strategies need to be crafted
                  accordingly.  },

  Abstract =     {The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest
                  Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 has
                  been passed by Parliament to address the injustice
                  done to tribal and adivasi communities and other
                  forest dwellers. It confers legal entitlements on
                  the lands they were cultivating for centuries. This
                  paper looks at various issues with regard to
                  implementation of the Act in the state of Andhra
                  Pradesh. It investigates why the Act emerged in
                  relation to ap. It also reviews the range of forest
                  rights deprivations and how they came about. The
                  authors consider the likely livelihood impact of
                  such a pro-poor institutional reform on the people
                  of the state.  },

                  when wealth is held constant, children in Bangladesh
                  are taller. This gap can be fully accounted for by
                  differences in open defecation, and especially by
                  open defecation in combination with differences in

  Abstract =     {The combining of benefits for human nutrition and
                  agricultural productivity, resulting from breeding
                  staple food crops which are more efficient in the
                  micronutrient metal uptake from the soil, and which
                  accumulate more micronutrients into their seeds,
                  results in extremely high ex ante estimates of
                  benefit/costs ratios for investments in agricultural
                  research in this area. This finding derives from the
                  confluence of several complementary factors:* Rates
                  of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing
                  countries, as are the consequent costs to human
                  welfare and economic productivity. * Because staple
                  foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the
                  malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple foods
                  (fortified by the plants themselves during growth)
                  can rely on existing consumer behavior. * A
                  significant percentage of the soils in which these
                  staple foods are grown are `deficient' in these
                  micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields
                  low. In general, these soils in fact contain
                  relatively high total amounts of micronutrient
                  metals. However, because of binding to soil
                  constituents, these nutrients have poor soil
                  availability to staple crop varieties that are
                  currently available to farmers. * Adoption and
                  spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by
                  farmers can rely on profit incentives, either
                  because of agronomic advantages on trace
                  mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of
                  nutritional improvements in the most productive
                  varieties being released by agricultural research
                  stations. * Benefits to relatively small investments
                  in agricultural research may be disseminated widely,
                  potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of
                  people and millions of hectares of cropland. *
                  Benefits from breeding advances, derived from
                  initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high
                  recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly
                  sustainable as long as an effective domestic
                  agricultural research infrastructure is
                  maintained. },

@article{carvalho2013961,
  Abstract =     {Abstract About half of the world population suffers
                  from the malnutrition of iron, zinc, calcium, iodine
                  and selenium. Most of the major staple crops of the
                  world, such as rice, wheat, cassava, beans, sweet
                  potato, pearl millet or maize are often deficient in
                  some of these mineral elements. Hence, increasing
                  the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients in
                  edible crop tissues (biofortification) has become a
                  promising strategy in modern agriculture, allowing
                  the access of more nutritious foods, to more people,
                  with the use of fewer resources. Traditional
                  agricultural practices can partly enhance the
                  nutritional value of plant foods, but the advances
                  in the `omics' technologies are rapidly being
                  exploited to engineer crops with enhanced key
                  nutrients. Ionomics, or the study of the ionome
                  (which can be defined as the mineral trace element
                  composition of a particular organism), is a modern
                  functional genomics tool that can provide high
                  throughput information about the broad spectrum
                  nutrient composition of a given plant food. In
                  alliance with other `omics' technologies, such as
                  genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics it can be
                  used to identify numerous genes with important roles
                  in the uptake, transport and accumulation of mineral
                  nutrients in plant foods, in particular in their
                  edible parts. This review provides a critical
                  comparison of the strategies that have been
                  developed to diminish nutrient deficiencies in
                  plant-based foods (SWOT analysis) and a summary of
                  the gene families involved in the mineral nutrient
                  pathways. Finally, it also discusses how `omics'
                  techniques can be used in genetic engineering
                  programs to increase mineral levels and
                  bioavailability in the most important staple food
                  crops and the socioeconomic implications of
                  plant-based biofortified foods. },

  Abstract =     {Universalising health coverage is the current goal
                  of the health service system in India. Tax-funded
                  insurance for poor families is the method chosen for
                  attaining this objective. The Rashtriya Swasthya
                  Bima Yojana was rolled out in 2008 for households
                  below the poverty line, enabling them to access
                  health services in the public and private
                  sectors. However, experience from different
                  countries shows tax-funded insurance systems work
                  well only in settings where public provisioning of
                  healthcare services prevails. State-funded targeted
                  insurance schemes do not seriously mitigate
                  inequitable access to health services in a
                  fundamentally private healthcare delivery market.},

  Abstract =     {National Sample Survey data on the unit values of a
                  large number of foods can be used to compute price
                  index numbers that can be compared with the official
                  national price indices, the Consumer Price Index for
                  Agricultural Labourers for rural India, and the
                  Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers for
                  urban India. This paper finds that over the five
                  years from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, the food component
                  of the cpial understated the rate of food price
                  inflation. This understatement can be attributed to
                  the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and
                  the resultant over-weighting of cereals, whose
                  prices fell relative to other foods. The overall
                  weight of food in the cpial is also too large, so
                  that the growth in the general cpial was understated
                  during this period when food prices fell relative to
                  non-food prices. Under conservative assumptions, the
                  paper calculates that the five-year growth in the
                  reported cpial of 10.6 per cent should have been
                  14.3 per cent. The nominal poverty lines are also
                  understated. As a result, and ignoring other
                  problems with the counts, the official poverty ratio
                  of 28.3 per cent for rural India in 2004-05 should
                  be closer to 31 per cent; at current rates of rural
                  poverty reduction, this eliminates more than three
                  years of progress.},

  Abstract =     {Reassessment of Irrigation Potential B D Dhawan THAT
                  there was something amiss with our statistics of
                  irrigation potential, developed over the plans
                  through public, private and institutional
                  investments, arose time and again during the course
                  of innumerable probings by academic persons into the
                  problem of underutilisation of irrigation capacity
                  in {I}ndia. Misgivings about their being on the high
                  side were reinforced whenever the reported estimates
                  of irrigation potential utilised were compared by
                  some scholars with data from alternative
                  sources. For example, these estimates have tended to
                  exceed the levels based on our agricultural land
                  records. At the end of the Sixth Five- Ycar Plan (i
                  e, 1984-85), the national plan figure of gross
                  irrigated area was placed at 60.58 mha, almost 6 mha
                  more than the corresponding figure of 54.67 mha as
                  per the compilation from land utilisation
                  records. More up-to-date comparison is not possible
                  because data from land record sources are available
                  with a lag of 4-5 year period. In viewof this lag
                  planners are forced to rely on data in respect of
                  plan achievements (in respect of irrigation
                  potential created and utilised) as per the reports
                  of the states which in turn, go by the claims made
                  in this regard by their irrigation departments
                  manned mostly by engineers.  },

                  confusing picture of groundwater exploitation in
                  {I}ndia. As per the irrigated area figures of the
                  Planning Commission, development of groundwater
                  irrigation has reached disturbing levels in many
                  states, notably UP. Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil
                  Nadu. But the less known volumetric statistics in
                  respect of groundwater irrigation compiled at the
                  behest of the Central Groundwater Board are rather
                  reassuring. Barring a dozen districts of the West
                  Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to
                  have reached the danger mark of groundwater
                  over-exploitation. The reality is somewhere between
                  these extremes, more likely nearer to the Board's
                  than the Commission's assessment.  },

                  to rise much faster than the income benefits,

  Abstract =     {A recent survey in two districts of Jharkhand found
                  many serious flaws in the implementation of the new
                  National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Some of
                  them could be explained as teething problems. As the
                  experience of Rajasthan shows, there is scope for
                  better implementation. All said and done, NREGA has
                  created a sense of hope amongst the rural poor. This
                  sense of hope can be further strengthened if people
                  understand that the act gives them employment as a
                  matter of right, and that claiming this right is
                  within the realm of possibility.},

  Abstract =     {Sources and Methods of Collection Jayanti Ghanekar
                  Discussion about the impact of the New Economic
                  Policy only casually refers to agricultural
                  labourers and their wages. Further, the methods of
                  wage data collection seem to have attracted
                  negligible attention of researchers and the
                  government agencies collecting and publishing such
                  data. The attitude of indifference also gets
                  reflected in the manner the problem of minimum wage
                  determination is handled. Though the labour unions
                  have done commendable work on this issue, they have
                  not been able to get a proper minimum wage
                  determined. Therefore, understanding various sources
                  of wage data and their respective methods of
                  collection is important to get qualitatively
                  reliable data.  },

  Abstract =     {The census offers an irreplaceable dataset to
                  examine local settings and study them on various
                  scales, from a global perspective contrasting
                  regional trends down to villagewise variations. This
                  paper seeks to demonstrate that irrigation data from
                  the {I}ndian census has been severely underutilised
                  in this regard, and also offers a view on the issues
                  that can be researched using village level
                  statistics.},

  Abstract =     {Much of India&#39;s nutrition agenda is being driven

                  partnerships and so-called multi-stakeholder
                  dialogues. The new strategies of transnational
                  corporations fall under the category of manipulation
                  by association, where they establish their role and
                  legitimacy by associating themselves with key
                  institutions and people. A prime example of this is
                  the influential 2013 series on maternal and child
                  nutrition published by the Lancet. This comment
                  analyses the issue and proposes some solutions.  },

  Abstract =     {The data from the National Sample Survey Office's
                  66th round survey highlight a steep fall in the
                  female work participation rate between 2004-05 and
                  2009-10. Examining some of the explicit and
                  not-so-explicit trends in women's work participation
                  in {I}ndia from 1993-94 to 2009-10, this paper
                  argues that indications are that there is a crisis
                  in women's employment under liberalisation-led
                  growth. It shows how specific attention given to
                  unpaid work in nss data can overturn standard
                  assumptions on women's employment and that this is
                  vitally important to discussions on employment
                  growth in {I}ndia.},

  Abstract =     {Any discussion on universal health coverage in India
                  is premature without a comprehensive understanding
                  of public financing of health coverage in the
                  country. This article analyses the government's
                  share of financial resources for health across
                  different agents, with particular focus on resources
                  for health coverage. An attempt is made to separate
                  spending for health in general and health coverage
                  in particular, and to examine the issue of
                  equity. The analysis indicates that the present
                  health coverage system is inadequate and iniquitous,
                  with various systems running at different costs. It
                  suggests consolidating finances and moving towards a
                  more unified system to realise the benefits of
                  efficiency gains.},

  Abstract =     {This paper attempts to understand the processes of
                  growth in rural non-farm employment based on the
                  2009-10 employment and unemployment round of the
                  National Sample Survey Office. The rural non-farm
                  sector has undergone major restructuring which has
                  led to an increase in the share of casual labour in
                  the non-farm sector accompanied by a continuous
                  decline in the share of self and regular
                  employment. On the basis of multivariate analyses at
                  two levels, this study concludes that though
                  non-farm employment in rural areas is primarily
                  distress-driven, there are some significant entry
                  barriers for rural workers in the nonfarm sector in
                  terms of education, age and gender. Considering the
                  overall deceleration of rural employment until
                  2009-10, the paper emphasises the importance of
                  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
                  Scheme in rural employment generation and the
                  consequent process of feminisation of casual
                  workforce in the non-farm sector that has emerged in
                  the last five years. The results indicate the crisis
                  of joblessness would have been more acute without
                  the scheme. The overall quality of rural employment,
                  driven by distress factors, has deteriorated in
                  2009-10 over 2004-05 in a significant way.  },

  Abstract =     {The growth of gross domestic product in every
                  sub-sector of the {I}ndian economy accelerated
                  during the second half of the 2000s, compared to the
                  first half of the decade. However, employment growth
                  in most sectors except construction
                  decelerated. This jobless growth was partly the
                  result of positive changes such as the reduction of
                  &quot;distress employment&quot; in agriculture,
                  created during the previous half-decade, and an
                  expansion in the population of students. Rural wages
                  rose and average educational levels of the workforce
                  improved. Government interventions in rural {I}ndia
                  since the mid-2000s, particularly the Mahatma Gandhi
                  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, seemed to
                  have aided these positive transformations. However,
                  manufacturing employment in the country fell and
                  employment growth slowed down in most constituents
                  of the services sector. The new jobs generated were
                  predominantly in rural construction. The slow
                  progress in the diversification of {I}ndia&#39;s
                  employment structure has led to large-scale
                  withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the
                  number of women thus &quot;missing&quot; being as
                  large as the population of Brazil.  },

  Abstract =     {The working-age population of {{I}ndia} is growing
                  in size, the labour force is shifting away from
                  agriculture and, with higher education, workers are
                  also seeking better-quality non-agricultural
                  jobs. However, the trends between 2004-05 and
                  2011-12 indicate that employment generation in the
                  country has been inadequate to meet this
                  challenge. Construction has virtually become the
                  only source of incremental employment in rural
                  {I}ndia. In the urban areas, men have been able to
                  obtain a disproportionate share of high-productivity

  Abstract =     {This article presents an investigation into
                  strategies employed by privately-owned companies to
                  gain access to land for resource extraction in
                  Jharkhand where much of the land being put under the
                  shovel is inalienable adivasi or tribal land and
                  deedless commons. It concludes that although policy
                  reforms are welcome, cosmetic changes in mineral
                  governance laws are inadequate to protect the
                  interests of the poor. It suggests an alternative
                  vision, a complete overhaul of mineral ownership to
                  allow the poor to share the revenue benefits.},

  Abstract =     {Using 2009-10 National Sample Survey data, this
                  paper describes patterns of job-seeking, rationing,
                  and participation in the Mahatma Gandhi National
                  Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. At the national
                  level, it finds that the self-targeting design of
                  MGNREGS leads to greater rates of self-selection
                  into the programme by poorer and scheduled tribe or
                  scheduled caste households. However, the
                  administrative rationing of MGNREGS jobs is not
                  pro-poor but exhibits a sort of middle-class
                  bias. At the state level, roughly half of 27 states
                  exhibit rationing and participation profiles that
                  signal effective pro-poor targeting; the other half
                  struggle to avoid high rates and regressive patterns
                  of administrative rationing of jobs to which the
                  poor have a legal right.  },

  Abstract =     {Micronutrient malnutrition affects more than half of
                  the world population, particularly in developing
                  countries. Concerted international and national
                  fortification and supplementation efforts to curb
                  the scourge of micronutrient malnutrition are
                  showing a positive impact, alas without reaching the
                  goals set by international
                  organizations. Biofortification, the delivery of
                  micronutrients via micronutrient-dense crops, offers
                  a cost-effective and sustainable approach,
                  complementing these efforts by reaching rural
                  populations. Bioavailable micronutrients in the
                  edible parts of staple crops at concentrations high
                  enough to impact on human health can be obtained
                  through breeding, provided that sufficient genetic
                  variation for a given trait exists, or through
                  transgenic approaches. Research and breeding
                  programs are underway to enrich the major food
                  staples in developing countries with the most
                  important micronutrients: iron, provitamin A, zinc
                  and folate. },

  Abstract =     {Summary Biofortification is increasingly seen as an
                  additional tool to combat micronutrient
                  malnutrition. This paper estimates the costs and
                  potential benefits of biofortification of globally
                  important staple food crops with provitamin A, iron,
                  and zinc for twelve countries in Africa, Asia, and
                  Latin America. Using a modification of the
                  Disability-Adjusted Life Years framework we conclude
                  that overall, the intervention can make a
                  significant impact on the burden of micronutrient
                  deficiencies in the developing world in a highly
                  cost-effective manner. Results differ by crop,
                  micronutrient, and country; and major reasons
                  underlying these differences are identified to
                  inform policy. },

  Abstract =     {India witnessed a widening of income inequality
                  during the phase of acceleration in economic growth
                  in the post-reform period (1993-94 to 2004-05). This
                  paper analyses the issue by using different types of
                  inequality measurements like general entropy
                  indices, kernel density graphs, percentile of income
                  graphs and field decomposition. It finds two major
                  features of a rising inequality in urban areas: (a)
                  even with a doubling of per capita consumption
                  growth in the post-reform decade, the decline in
                  poverty was less by a quarter compared to the
                  pre-reform decade, and (b) in the post-reform
                  period, the growth of the wage rate of regular
                  workers was negative up to the 50th percentile of
                  wage earnings, and beyond that point, wage rate
                  growth turned positive and rose sharply to reach 5\%
                  per annum in highest quintile of wage earnings.  },

                  disadvantaged in respect to land, which largely
                  accounts for their perpetual poverty and makes them
                  vulnerable to injustice and exploitation, attempts
                  have been made by the union and state governments to
                  promote and protect their rights with regard to the
                  control and use of land. Based on 13 major states,
                  the present study shows that even after 50 years of
                  planned initiatives and policy measures, there has
                  not been substantial improvement in the landholding
                  status of scheduled groups, and in some states, it
                  has declined further.},

@article{mooij2001,
  Abstract =     {Public distribution of foodgrains in India is a
                  national policy, which exists in all states. In some
                  states, however, the public distribution system
                  (PDS) works much better than in other states. The
                  undivided state of Bihar (now the new Bihar and
                  Jharkhand) is one of the states in which the policy
                  works poorly. It is important to understand why this
                  is the case. Generally, policy changes and
                  recommendations do not take the specificities of
                  particular states into account. Yet, for the PDS
                  performance to improve in Bihar and Jharkhand, it is
                  absolutely necessary to understand why it works as
                  it does, what the main bottlenecks are and where
                  there are possibilities for improvement, if
                  any. This paper makes such an attempt: it describes
                  the PDS in Bihar and Jharkhand, not only in terms of
                  how it fails and what it does not accomplish, but
                  also in terms of what it is and what it does. It is
                  shown that while many people do benefit from the
                  present set-up, there are also people within almost
                  all categories of stakeholders who are dissatisfied
                  with the large-scale misappropriation of
                  foodgrains. It is argued that there is scope for
                  change, but change requires strategic political
                  manoeuvring and initially a low-key approach in
                  order not to awaken and antagonise strong vested
                  interests.},

  Abstract =     {This note examines costs and returns from the
                  cultivation of different types of cotton in a
                  rainfed village in the Vidarbha region of
                  Maharashtra, {I}ndia. While the pros and cons of GM
                  cotton are extensively debated, there are only a few
                  empirical studies on the economic performance of Bt
                  cotton, particularly under rainfed conditions. The
                  results from a detailed survey of farm business
                  incomes show that Bt cotton was a clear leader in
                  terms of production and gross value of output when
                  grown as a stand-alone crop. However, on the fields
                  of small and marginal farmers, where cotton was
                  usually intercropped with sorghum (or other cereals
                  and pulses), the relative income advantage of Bt
                  cotton declined. Further, expenditure on chemical
                  pesticides was higher for Bt cotton than for other
                  varieties of cotton. Variability in production was
                  also higher for Bt cotton than for other types of
                  cotton.},

@article{msvr_inequality_2011,
  Abstract =     {There is a misconception in the literature that
                  income distribution in {I}ndia is less unequal than,
                  for instance, in China or the countries of Latin
                  America. This misconception is based on a comparison
                  of like with unlike. Studies of income distribution
                  for most countries are based � as they should be �
                  on household income data, while corresponding
                  studies of income distribution for {I}ndia are based
                  on household consumption expenditure data, and it is
                  well known that consumption expenditure, by its very
                  nature, is less unequally distributed than
                  income. This paper examines levels of household
                  income inequality in rural {I}ndia using data from
                  in-depth village surveys conducted in eight villages
                  from four States of the country. Although the
                  data-set is relatively small, the exercise is rather
                  unique because of the lack of regular survey data on
                  household incomes for rural {I}ndia. The Gini
                  coefficient is used as a summary measure of income
                  inequality. Our estimates show high values of the
                  Gini (close to 0.60) in these eight villages; these
                  are comparable to levels reported for Latin
                  America. Of the eight villages, inequality was
                  relatively high in the three canal-irrigated
                  villages.},

@article{nssland2013,
  Abstract =     {This paper analyses National Sample survey data on
                  changes in the distribution of operational holdings
                  of land, using data from NSS surveys on employment
                  and unemployment. The paper discusses the
                  limitations of these statistics in some detail. Four
                  main points emerge from the analysis: there has been
                  a sharp rise in landlessness in rural {I}ndia; caste
                  disparities in access to land have persisted over
                  time; there has been a rise in inequality in
                  distribution of land cultivated by households; and
                  there has been a decline in the proportion of manual
                  labour households that combined wage labour with
                  cultivation of small holdings. Finally, statistics
                  on land distribution at the State level reveal some
                  puzzling features -- some of which point to possible
                  errors in data collection.},

  Abstract =     {The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
                  Education Act, 2009 promises free and compulsory
                  education to all children in the age group of 6-14
                  years. But the way this critical entitlement is
                  being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart
                  from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of
                  the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued
                  the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is
                  aimed at ushering in quality elementary education
                  for all. The problems are many, and this paper
                  observes that most of them can be connected to
                  inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of
                  ensuring that the Act&#39;s aims are fulfilled is to
                  bring in a common school system based on
                  neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering
                  variety of indifferent institutions we now have.  },

  Abstract =     {This paper estimates and compares the paid-out cost
                  of cultivation of wheat in {I}ndia, the most
                  state-protected crop, during the input subsidy
                  regime of the 1970s and 1980s and after its
                  abolition in the 1990s, when economic reforms were
                  initiated. The study uses the valuable time series
                  information collected as part of the "comprehensive
                  scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After
                  surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well
                  as costs of cultivation vis-{\`{a}}-vis the
                  wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price
                  level), the value of inputs which are exclusively
                  market-purchased are analysed. A study of the
                  weighted average of these costs establishes
                  unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs
                  increased very sharply in the post-reform period.},

@article{rajintermediate73,
  Abstract =     {of "Intermediate Regimes" IN a paper published in
                  1964, Kalecki used the term "intermediate regimes"
                  to describe governments in which the lower-middle
                  class and the rich peasantry could be identified as
                  performing the role of the ruling class.1 In the
                  past, he observed, whenever social up- heavels
                  brought their representatives to power they had
                  invariably served the interests of big business
                  often allied with the remnants of the feudal
                  system. However, certain conditions had emerged
                  recently in many underdeveloped countries which made
                  it possible for them to play a different role. The
                  specific conditions he cited were: the numerical
                  dominance of the lower middle class at the time of
                  achievement of the political independence of these
                  countries, the extensive involvement of governments
                  in economic activity, and the availability to; them
                  of credits from socialist countries. Given these
                  conditions, the state could, in his view, perform
                  the role of 'dynamic entrepreneurs', undertake the
                  basic investment necessary for economic development,
                  and promote "a pattern of amalgamation of the
                  interests of the lower middle class with state
                  capitalism.},

@article{ramakumarinvestment2012,
  Abstract =     {Public investment in agriculture has significant
                  poverty-reducing effects. This article attempts to
                  analyse trends in agricultural investments in
                  {I}ndia between the 1950s and the 2000s. It argues
                  that public investment and expenditure on
                  agriculture in {I}ndia have grown only slowly and
                  have not decisively increased even after more than
                  60 years of independence. While public capital
                  formation and expenditure do show a moderate rise in
                  the 2000s, a revival of {I}ndia's agricultural
                  growth requires a far greater thrust to public
                  spending. Major and medium irrigation projects
                  require special attention, as irrigation is
                  instrumental not just in raising yields, but also
                  the number of days of employment for
                  labourers. Increasing public investment in
                  agricultural research and extension is central to
                  bridging the yield gap that persists. Formal credit
                  flows to agriculture have to specifically target
                  small and marginal farmers, and emphasis should move
                  away from generating agricultural growth by
                  channelling credit to agri-business firms and
                  corporate players in agriculture. If {I}ndia's
                  second green revolution has to contribute to an
                  accelerated reduction of poverty, hunger and
                  malnourishment, it undoubtedly has to be a state-led
                  project.},

  Abstract =     {This paper details the results of a survey conducted
                  in selected areas of Jharkhand's Dumka
                  district. While inadequate infrastructure and the
                  lack of teachers affect the quality of teaching,
                  poverty is responsible for the alarming rates of
                  non-enrolment, dropouts and poor attendance of
                  pupils. Scheduled tribe children are particularly at
                  a disadvantage as education is not imparted in their
                  mother tongue. The state of primary education, as
                  this paper suggests, needs a multi-pronged effort to
                  ensure its greater effectiveness. While the
                  government can step in with incentives such as
                  midday meal schemes, community participation in the
                  governance of the primary schooling system has to be
                  ensured.},

  Abstract =     {The Indian decision to block adoption of a decision
                  on trade facilitation at the World Trade
                  Organisation has been portrayed as
                  &quot;short-sighted&quot;. If truth be told,
                  long-pending proposals for reforming the Agreement
                  on Agriculture were being sidelined, while
                  interested parties were pushing ahead with the new
                  agenda on trade facilitation. A clearer
                  understanding of the issues in agriculture vs the
                  issues in trade facilitation would enable a better
                  appreciation of what is at stake.  },

                  strategy for delivering micronutrients to rural
                  populations in developing countries. Crops are being
                  bred for higher levels of micronutrients using both
                  conventional and transgenic breeding methods;
                  several conventional varieties have been released,
                  while additional conventional and transgenic
                  varieties are in the breeding pipeline. The results
                  of efficacy and effectiveness studies, as well as
                  recent successes in delivery, provide evidence that
                  biofortification is a promising strategy for

  Abstract =     {The 55th round (1999-2000) of the NSS used a
                  different methodology from all previous rounds and
                  arrived at lower poverty estimates. The consensus
                  from earlier NSS rounds, that poverty reduction had
                  been set back during the 1990s, was challenged by
                  this data. This was bolstered by some 'adjustments',
                  which although agreeing that the 55th round had
                  overestimated poverty reduction, claimed that the
                  number of poor had nonetheless fallen by 30-45
                  million. However, a detailed re-examination shows
                  that these 'adjustments' were not correct. The
                  poverty ratio fell at most by 3 percentage points
                  between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, and it is likely that
                  the number of poor increased over this period. The
                  main lesson is that poverty estimates are very
                  sensitive to both survey design and post-survey
                  analysis. The first of a two-part article.},

  Abstract =     {This paper, in two parts, reports an evaluation of
                  existing in-kind food transfers. Part I outlines the
                  dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer
                  content and physical leakages, and deals with the
                  impact of these transfers on poverty as officially
                  measured. Part II reports the impact of these
                  transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some
                  issues regarding the financial cost of these
                  transfers. Contrary to the view that food
                  self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the
                  need for direct food interventions, the paper
                  reports a significant increase in contribution of
                  in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and
                  nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact
                  is attributable to improved public distribution
                  system efficiency. The first part, presented here,
                  was motivated by some issues that arose in the
                  context of the Tendulkar method of estimating
                  poverty as regards its treatment of food
                  prices. This method treats food prices differently
                  from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive
                  to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper
                  suggests a decomposition method that modifies the
                  Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between
                  household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers
                  received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty
                  reducing impact of these food transfers is found to
                  have increased over time and is more pronounced in
                  the case of distribution-sensitive measures of
                  poverty.  },

  Abstract =     {Part-II reports the impact of in-kind food transfers
                  on nutritional intake as measured by
                  calories. Econometric analysis using a simple
                  calorie demand function confirms the significance of
                  variables relating to public distribution system
                  access, controlling for other covariates, in its
                  contribution to calorie intake. Results also suggest
                  that the calorie-elasticity of PDS transfers is
                  twice as large compared to additional out-of-pocket
                  income equal to the cash equivalent of PDS
                  transfers. These are also confirmed by
                  non-parametric analysis of calorie intake of various
                  consumer groups. Although preliminary, these results
                  suggest caution in advocating cash transfers as
                  substitute of in-kind transfers. Finally, the paper
                  evaluates concerns about the financial implications
                  of the minimum support price-PDS system in light of
                  the recently enacted National Food Security Act.  },

  Abstract =     {The challenge of feeding 9 to 10 Billion people by
                  2050 may seem like a big enough challenge in itself,
                  but we also need to achieve this feat whilst, at the
                  same time, reducing adverse impacts of food
                  production on a whole range of ecosystem
                  services. One suggested response is ``sustainable
                  intensification'' which entails delivering safer,
                  nutritious food from the same area whilst
                  maintaining ecosystem service provision. In this
                  review, I examine sustainable intensification and
                  consider alternatives such as management of food
                  demand and waste reduction. I conclude that
                  sustainable intensification has a role to play, but
                  this must be accompanied by fundamental change in
                  global food systems. },

                  Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest
                  Rights) Act, 2006 has created controversy in West
                  Bengal. The gram sabha, the basic unit in the
                  process of forest rights recognition, has been
                  replaced by the gram sansad, denoting the village
                  level constituency under the panchayati raj
                  system. This has been followed by contiguous
                  arrangements as well as initiatives which are
                  inconsistent with the Act. All these factors have
                  led to undermining the spirit of the Act to promote
                  community governance of forests, which has invoked
                  stiff opposition from forest dwellers in the region.

  Abstract =     {This report revisits the theoretical concepts of
                  inequalities including their measurements, analyzes
                  their global trends, presents the policy makers'
                  perception of inequalities in 15 countries and
                  identifies various policy options in combating this
                  major development challenge of our time.  The report
                  makes the basic point that in spite of the
                  impressive progress humanity has made on many fronts
                  over the decades, it still remains deeply
                  divided. In that context, it is intended to help
                  development actors, citizens, and policy makers
                  contribute to global dialogues and initiate
                  conversations in their own countries about the
                  drivers and extent of inequalities, their impact,
                  and the ways in which they can be curbed.  This

@article{utsa1971,
  Abstract =     {In recent years there has emerged a tendency towards
                  profit-oriented production and investment in land by
                  a section of the cultivating population. Many
                  observers think they see a new class of capitalist
                  farmers emerging. There had been, however, no
                  quantitative studies attempting to isolate the
                  characteristics of capitalist farmers or to apply
                  any criteria to identify the capitalists. Ashok
                  Rudra with A Majid and B D Talib carried out a
                  sample survey of big farmers in Punjab and, after
                  attempting to isolate the capitalists from the
                  sample by certain statistical methods, came to the
                  conclusion that no group of capitalist farmers could
                  be identified. The author conducted a small survey
                  in 1969 of 66 big farmers scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states. The aim was to concentrate on
                  detailed case studies of big farmers selected
                  purposively with a wide geographical scatter. The
                  results of the survey show that a new class of
                  capitalist farmers is emerging. This is a phenomenon
                  common to every region, insofar as every area has
                  been subject to the same forces - albeit operating
                  with varying intensity - of an expanding market and
                  enhanced profitability of agricultural
                  production. The rate at which capitalist development
                  is occurring varies widely in different regions
                  depending on many historical and current
                  circumstances; it may be near zero in some: but the
                  reality of the process cannot be denied.},

@article{utsa1972,
  Abstract =     {This paper argues that a very considerable
                  difference is made to the behaviour of farm
                  variables with changing economic size of farms (i e,
                  changing scale of production), depending on how we
                  measure this economic size. With acreage as the
                  measure of economic size, i e, of the scale of
                  production, we obtain one set of results; with an
                  alternative index of the scale of production, we may
                  obtain diametrically opposite results. Further, in a
                  situation of changing techniques, as at present, the
                  grouping of farm data by acreage is likely to
                  obscure some very important features of the dynamics
                  of agricultural change. We propose to illustrate the
                  argument with data on farm economics collected by us
                  as part of a study of the growth of capitalist
                  farming from 66 large farms scattered over 10
                  districts in 5 states in 1969. [The author would

@article{vikasirrigation1,
  Abstract =     {West Bengal lacks an integrated system of collection
                  of data on irrigation. Collection of data on
                  different types of irrigation systems in the state
                  has been left to different agencies. These agencies
                  are not geared to systematic collection of
                  statistics and the data provided by them are not
                  regular and are often inconsistent. As a result, no
                  reliable statistics exist that could be used to
                  identify patterns of irrigation at the state-level -
                  leave aside doing such exercises at district, block
                  or village levels - with a level of accuracy that is
                  possible for some of the other states. This paper
                  provides an overview of the different sources of
                  data on irrigation in West Bengal and discusses the
                  nature of the data available from each source.},

  Abstract =     {In this paper, we examine inequality in incomes
                  between households of different castes in rural
                  {I}ndia, using a unique dataset comprising household
                  data from a cross-section of eight villages across
                  four States. The focus of this paper is on Dalit or
                  Scheduled Caste households. We begin with very
                  simple measures of differences between groups, such
                  as proportional representation in different
                  quintiles and the frequency distribution of
                  households across income levels in different social
                  groups. We then estimate a standard GE(2) inequality
                  index along with its decomposition by caste. Lastly,
                  we compute an alternative benchmark for assessing
                  the share of between-group inequality in total
                  inequality as suggested by Elbers, Lanjouw,
                  Mistiaen, and Ozler (ELMO 2008). Our analysis shows
                  high levels of income inequality between households
                  of different caste groups.},

  Abstract =     {This paper examines migration for live-in domestic
                  work from Jharkhand through a multi-method
                  approach. Gumla district, one of the major source
                  areas, scores very low on development indicators and
                  witnesses high levels of female outmigration
                  throughout the year. Looking at data on educational
                  levels, migration processes and social relations at
                  the village level, the confluence of factors based
                  on tribe, gender, religion and education that
                  perpetuates trends of migration for live-in domestic
                  work from the region are highlighted. },
